1,when people hear ai they often think about sentient robots and magic boxes ai today is much more mundane and simple—but that does not mean it is not powerful another misconception is that high profile research projects can be applied directly to any business situation ai done right can create an extreme return on investments rois —for instance through automation or precise prediction but it does take thought time and proper implementation we have seen that success and value generated by ai projects are increased when there is a grounded understanding and expectation of what the technology can deliver from the c suite down “artificial intelligence ai is a science and a set of computational technologies that are inspired by—but typically operate quite differently from—the ways people use their nervous systems and bodies to sense learn reason and take action ” lately there has been a big rise in the day to day use of machines powered by ai these machines are wired using cross disciplinary approaches based on mathematics computer science statistics psychology and more virtual assistants are becoming more common most of the web shops predict your purchases many companies make use of chatbots in their customer service and many companies use algorithms to detect fraud ai and deep learning technology employed in office entry systems will bring proper time tracking of each employee as this system tries to learn each person with an image processing technology whose data is feed forwarded to a deep learning model where deep learning is not an algorithm per se but rather a family of algorithms that implements deep networks many layers these networks are so deep that new methods of computation such as graphics processing units gpus are required to train them in addition to clusters of compute nodes so using deep learning we can take detect the employee using face and person recognition scan and through which login logout timing is recorded using an ai system we can even identify each employee's entry time their working hours non working hours by tracking the movement of an employee in the office so that system can predict and report hr for the salary for each employee based on their working hours our system can take feed from cctv to track movements of employees and this system is capable of recognizing a person even he she is being masked as in this pandemic situation by taking their iris scan with this system installed inside the office the following are some of the benefits compliance litigation needs for several countries regulations insist that the employer must keep documents available that can demonstrate the working hours performed by each employee in the event of control from the labor inspectorate or a dispute with an employee the employer must be able to explain and justify the working hours for the company this can be made easy as our system is tracking employee movements information security needs this is about monitoring user connection times to detect suspicious access times in the event where compromised credentials are used to log on at a m on a saturday a notification on this access could alert the it team that an attack is possibly underway employee login logout software to manage and react to employees' attendance overtime thresholds productivity and suspicious access times our system records and stores detailed and interactive reporting on users' connection times these records allow you to better manage users' connection times and provide accurate detailed data required by management if you want to avoid paying overtime make sure that your employees respect certain working time quotas or even avoid suspicious access our system will alert the hr officer about each employee's office in and out time so that they can accordingly take action last but not least it reduces human resource needs to keep track of the records and sending the report to hr and hr officials has to check through the report so this system will reduce times and human resource needs with the use of ai and deep learning technologies we can automate some routines stuff with more functionality which humans need more resources to keep track thereby reducing time spent on manual data entry works rather companies can think of making their position high in the competitive world blackcoffer

3,if you were a fan of the 's film clueless back in the day then you will remember the protagonist cher horowitz's amazing virtual wardrobe she used it to browse her clothing and choose a perfectly coordinated ensemble this virtual application which was just the brainchild of a writer wanting to make the protagonist look rich fashionable and ahead of her time ignited a buzz and prospected having an automated style device to make everyday dress up fun and engagingly time saving times have changed and technological advancement today is transforming everything from probabilities to possibilities we are in the era where machines not just facilitate our tasks and demands but rather suggest forecasts and analyze thus making lives simpler and smarter with the advent of technology style suggestions are just a fraction of the big picture that ai has painted in the fashion industry today what is ai artificial intelligence is the creation of computer programs capable of performing activities and solving issues that would normally need human intelligence ai has surged across a variety of industries with the potential to transform businesses through creative technologies and more effective operational processes at first ai automation did not appear to be an appealing tool for fashion leaders to use in an industry focused on creative ability and expression however as we enter the hyper digital era these apps have the potential to revolutionize enterprises and generate considerable industry growth when compared to competitors that use traditional approaches some of the most well known brands in the business are now investing in algorithms that assist buyers to choose designs a slew of ai based start ups is also assisting everyone from retailers to customers in removing the guesswork from the equation impact on fashion this article examines how artificial intelligence has impacted key areas of the fashion industry as well as explores brands that have benefited from its use ai in apparel designing fashion firms are utilizing technology to better understand client wants and produce better garments thanks to more sophisticated data collection tommy hilfiger pioneered the “reimagine retail” project which trains fashion designers with ai design skills in collaboration with ibm as a result fashion students could master a variety of technical skills such as natural language processing nlp or computer vision fashion students could learn from thousands of fashion related photos using ai which increased their inventiveness and shortened lead times for the fashion firm ai in the manufacturing process fashion brands are now able to identify fast changing fashion trends and get the latest fashion accessories to store shelves faster than the “traditional” fashion shop thanks to ai and machine learning capabilities as a result prominent fashion brands such as zara top shop and h m can provide immediate gratification to retail customers by identifying seasonal trends and producing the appropriate quantity of the current items ai in logistics ai in inventory and supply chain management helps to speed up processes by optimizing routes and lowering logistics and shipping costs companies use ai to automate logistics and supply chain procedures for speedier delivery or to locate alternate routes for vehicles that have been detoured due to unanticipated situations like bad weather or road construction owing to lockdown major fashion firms had to rethink their go to market strategy overnight with actual brick and mortar stores closed and people staying away from shopping malls myntra finds itself in a unique position to assist them myntra moved its whole data infrastructure including supply chain management inventory and website capabilities to microsoft azure just before the pandemic apart from giving myntra the flexibility to respond to demand spikes azure's built in machine learning technologies sped up the development of advanced analytics capabilities allowing them to better understand their customers ai in fashion retail in retail ai and machine learning are also providing an automated solution to monitor customer activities while shopping and visualize their sentiments to learn what products they prefer to buy and what products they ignore ai can also track traffic in retail stores or record consumer shopping experiences with the option of receiving feedback on how their experience was while shopping at the store allowing them to enhance their services uniqlo has ai powered umood kiosks that offer clients a selection of products and use neurotransmitters to assess their reaction to color and style the kiosk then makes product recommendations based on each person's reactions customers do not even need

us to find those elusive perfect garments that suit our body types and fashion preferences these ai enabled garments and ensembles are personalized to the user's style body type colors and current fashion trends as well as different situations and weather iluk is an ai based personal stylist that uses computer vision and d reconstruction technology at its core to provide technology based personal styling it is shaped like a pod that will be placed in a store ai in fast fashion with smart mirror similarly a smart mirror driven by ai is being utilized by a company to streamline consumers' shopping experiences by allowing them to virtually visualize how items would appear on them without having to put them on their bodies the ai smart mirror with touch screen glasses is mounted in the changing room of retail stores and relays information on whether or not a person is inside customers can also use this mirror to try on other sizes and colors as well as receive tailored mix and match alternatives to complete the appearance van heusen designed a storage space that includes a “virtual trial” mirror that allows customers to view how clothes might appear on them by scanning the item's barcode and stepping in front of the mirror while virtual clothing is projected onto their reflection ai in ecommerce in the same way that ai is revolutionizing retail fashion stores ai is revolutionizing online purchasing and e commerce while browsing or searching for fashion goods on e commerce sites ai suggests additional items that are similar to what you are looking for based on your color preferences budget and other factors it analyses your search history data and suggests more relevant stuff you should look at amazon has undoubtedly transformed the online shopping experience with its ai powered product suggestion engine amazon is implementing an ai enabled fashion designer algorithm that can create clothing by mimicking the design styles of several popular garments and applying them to a new garment the echo look fashion assistant which uses machine learning to deliver personalized recommendations is amazon's other use case ai in visual search — to find the products using camera ai based visual search technology is now employed by e commerce stores to comprehend the content and context of these photographs and produce a list of related results you can capture an object using your camera and then search for it online retailers can use ai enabled computer vision based visual search technology to propose thematically or aesthetically relevant items to customers in a way that would be difficult to do with only a word query neiman marcus a high end department store employs artificial intelligence to make it easier for shoppers to locate things the snap find shop the app allows users to photograph items they encounter while out and about and then search neiman marcus' inventory for the same or a comparable item ai in fashion and sustainability one of the most damaging businesses on the earth is the fashion industry artificial intelligence can be used in conjunction with machine learning deep learning natural language processing visual recognition and data analytics to reduce trend prediction errors and more precisely forecast patterns leading to fewer garments being manufactured and subsequently underutilized the h m group is using “amplified intelligence ” which combines analytics and ai with human intelligence using artificially intelligent technologies h m is enhancing its ability to recognize trends and organize logistics as well as minimizing the frequency of discounted deals and large amounts of unsold goods though intelligence per se is artificial nevertheless is likely to have an earnest impact both positive and negative the fashion dilemma apparel manufacture is a labor intensive industry in the fashion industry ai enabled machines and robots can perfectly stitch fabrics while also detecting fabric flaws and providing quality assurance to ensure that the actual design hues will match the new colors in nations like bangladesh where the garment industry accounts for of the gdp this will have a significant influence on the labor force in the long run it is already feeling the heat from these specialized ai based devices thus jeopardizing the jobs of breadwinners ai should not be viewed as a rival but rather as a collaborator the cost and ethics of ai are currently preventing us from progressing we must be careful not to use technology to increase inequity or exacerbate social injustice we also need to find a balance and integrate humanity into the machines we are constructing in the future virtual wonderland “we are being monitored and classified by ai in portions of our lives that were not previously watched ” says sophie hackford a futurist and keynote speaker she wonders if we have built the “wrong” internet we created it intending to monetize our viewers in mind rather than the dynamic knowledge sharing area that tim berners lee envisioned at the start ” she believes that in the future we will be much more selective in how we obtain information and that “bots” would be critical in meeting our requirements as a result the gains will come at the expense of our privacy as numerous as ai's advantages are it is impossible to ignore the difficult issues it brings with everything being data driven there is a pressing need to establish boundaries to build a shared ecosystem that benefits both businesses and the general public conclusion finding a wise balance between physical stores and online stores will continue to be a crucial issue in an industry where brick and mortar retail locations are still an important element of the sector's approach to business the usefulness of chatbots aimed at improving online and in store product navigation shows significant promise for preserving customer attention and use in the near term we expect consumers to become accustomed to these capabilities over time and the field to become more competitive as ai becomes more broadly applied as prominent brands set the tone with their usage of ai it is too early to tell how these ai applications will affect earnings and cost savings because prominent fashion firms are still in the early stages of ai implementation however there will be a learning curve as

5,from the stone age to the modern world from hunting and gathering to cultivating crops from living in caves to building communities we have come a long way to become the most evolved creature on the planet so what is that one thing which is a guiding force throughout this process i believe in simple words we can say to enhance the experience of life or in other words to boost our productivity level once the basic need of food cloth and shelter is taken care of we want a comfortable life good education proper healthcare and the list goes on this urgency and endless need pushed us to make breakthrough inventions that made human life more comfortable and productive first humans invented electricity then the computers came after that portable computing devices like laptops and mobile phones became operative and now artificial intelligence or ai is a buzzword every creation by human beings transformed human life on the face of this planet from living in the mud house to building skyscrapers from riding a bullock cart to flying an aircraft from posting letters to making video calls and now from computers to ai or artificial intelligence is yet another groundbreaking invention of humankind which can revolutionize our lifestyle forever artificial intelligence productivity problem solving technology machine human so what is artificial intelligence or ai we can say in simple words that ai is the ability of a computer program to think and learn rationally it is about pattern recognition analyzing images and videos and learning natural language processing and understanding it is more about creating a technology that can in some cases replace what humans do however to me personally the most crucial part of the definition of ai is the application to solve problems intelligently and rationally using algorithms that enables us to have computers find deep patterns that we may not have even known exist ai is like a complex series and layers of algorithms that create a neural network that processes data and information coming into the system and derives knowledge from it ai is a complicated and broad concept where machine learning is a subset of ai and deep learning a specialized subset of machine learning according to a study by pwc trillion of gdp will be added between now and based on ai the economic impact of this scale has never been seen before and it is not just in the it industry but impacts virtually every industry and aspect of our lives so now the question is how people around us are using this enigmatic technology we use ai all the time but mostly we are unaware of it we use ai whenever we type in a search query on a search engine every time we use our gps or whenever we use any voice recognition system what we can do with artificial intelligence is unlimited whenever we do anything on any technology we are using some form of machine learning or artificial intelligence ai means different things to different people ai facilitating machines and humans to understand and interact with each other creating new opportunities and new ways of doing business for example a videogame designer will use ai to jot down the code that affects how bots play and observe their reaction a data scientist can use ai to explore and classify data to fulfill specific goals law enforcement agencies can use ai to identify criminals in video feeds top of form bottom of form in the educational sector ai can provide students with conversational interfaces and on demand online tutors customer service chatbots improved customer experience by resolving queries on the spot and freeing up agent time for conversations that add value chatbots powered by natural language processing capabilities are employed in healthcare to interact with patients and run diagnoses like real doctors ai powered advances in speech to text technology have made real time transcription possible self driving cars facial recognition in social media apps and image detection are possible because of ai watson alexa siri cortana and google assistant are also a gift of ai in medicine ai is helping doctors arrive at more accurate preliminary diagnoses reading medical imaging finding appropriate clinical trials for patients it is not just influencing patient outcomes but also making operational processes less expensive it is helping patients with lou gehrig's disease for example regain their original voice in place of using a computerized voice ai is impacting the quality of our lives daily there is ai in our netflix queue our navigation apps keeping spam out of our inboxes and reminding us of important events ai monitor our investments detecting fraudulent transactions identifying credit card fraud and preventing financial crimes ai has the potential to access enormous amounts of information imitate humans even specific humans make life changing recommendations about health and finances correlate data that may invade privacy and much more so what we have understood is ai has penetrated our day to day life now the question is how people can use it in the best possible way to extract value from it and boost their productivity even further here are some of my suggestions empowering people with disabilities more than one billion people around the globe live with any form of disability which accounts for around of the population ai or robot if used correctly can turn out to be a blessing for these people ai can provide preliminary support to make their life a little easier and efficient for example the world renounced scientist stephen hawkins lived most of his life with the assistance of ai and other technology likewise for the paralyzed people ai or a robot can help to do basic day to day activities for a blind person ai can work as a personal assistant who can provide text to speech translation writing assistance and support in other regular activities whether a person is blind deaf or paralyzed it does not matter ai can be a life changing tool for them boosting the quality of self study ai can transform our educational system completely just imagine how it would have been if there were not any means of doing online education in this pandemic and lockdown our entire education would have come to a halt i believe post pandemic the world may shift more to an online medium both for work and education other than that we sometimes face difficulties in self study their artificial intelligence can help by understanding explaining and providing the correct information at the right time just imagine how efficient a

6,artificial intelligence ai is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence advances in ai software and hardware especially deep learning algorithms and the graphics processing units gpus that power their training have led to a recent and rapidly increasing interest in medical ai applications in clinical diagnostics ai based computer vision approaches are poised to revolutionize image based diagnostics while other ai subtypes have begun to show similar promise in various diagnostic modalities in some areas such as clinical genomics a specific type of ai algorithm known as deep learning is used to process large and complex genomic datasets ai has two main applications in genetics identification of harmful genes and treatment of disease let us take a look at how each of these applications works also with some good gps trackers you can implement them on your vehicle ai is also being used to identify genetic mutations within tumors using d imaging ai is very useful in personalized medicine which requires treatments to be specified to one patient's needs versus another the of our dna that is unique to us has more than three million differences the rise of ai in genomics is unsurprising genomics – a ‘big data' field – requires computational approaches to interrogate the enormous volume of data generated by sequencing technologies and to marry it in meaningful ways with other biological and clinical data analyzing these datasets for new biological insights can be especially difficult when the rules have to be explicitly predefined step by step within the computer code instead machine learning techniques can learn from data without the need to specify explicit rules although a highly useful tool ai is not without challenge the key issue of ai in genomics is scale – with the amount of genomics data being generated exponentially growing slavé petrovski head of genome analytics and informatics at astrazeneca's centre for genomics research gcr says that – “ai in genomics can be extended across different omic studies such as transcriptomics ” although there are challenges of having the infrastructure and resources to cope with large datasets and mine it effectively if managed correctly the problem is eliminated slavé petrovski highlighted a key piece of research conducted by astrazeneca which presented a multi dimensional machine learning framework taking into account layers of information including gene expression human disease literature and mouse phenotypes this approach is proposed as a “support framework for objectively and quantitatively triaging potential novel disease target genes another focus within genomic ai is the strengthening of data petrovski remarks that this area is “constantly evolving ” but a key observation is that the method adopted is often not as important as the underlying data this means that the information inputted into ai systems must be of high quality or it cannot be used to its full potential genetics is always a data driven science and largely utilizes machine learning to capture dependencies in data and derive biological hypotheses however the ability to extract new insights from the exponentially increasing volume of genomics data requires more expressive machine learning models by effectively combining large data sets deep learning has transformed the field and now it is becoming the method of choice for many genomics modeling tasks including predicting the impact of genetic variation on gene regulatory mechanisms such as dna accessibility and splicing in recent years deep learning has been widely used in diverse fields of biology in biology applications of deep learning are gaining increasing popularity in predicting the structure and function of genomic elements such as promoters enhancers or gene expression levels the application of deep learning to genomic datasets is an exciting rapidly developing area and is primed to revolutionize genome analysis deep learning has been successfully implemented in areas such as image recognition or robotics e g self driving cars and is most useful when large amounts of data are available in this respect using deep learning as a tool in the field of genomics is entirely apt although it is still in somewhat early stages deep learning in genomics has the potential to inform fields such as cancer diagnosis and treatment clinical genetics crop improvement epidemiology and public health population genetics evolutionary or phylogenetic analyses and functional genomics also in recent years deep learning dl methods have been considered in the context of genomic prediction the dl methods are nonparametric models that provide flexibility to adapt to complicated associations between data and output and adapt to very complex patterns the applications of deep learning dl methods in genomic selection gs to obtain a meta picture of gs performance and highlight how these tools can help solve challenging plant breeding problems we also provide general guidance for the effective use of dl methods including the fundamentals of dl and the requirements for its appropriate use the main requirement for using dl is the quality and sufficiently large training data there is clear evidence that dl algorithms capture nonlinear patterns more efficiently than conventional genome based deep learning algorithms can integrate data from different sources as is usually needed in gs and it shows the ability for improving prediction accuracy for large breeding data it is important to apply dl to large training testing data sets functional genomic analysis in the field in which deep learning has made the most inroads to date the availability of vast troves of data of various types dna rna methylation chromatin accessibility histone modifications chromosome interactions and so forth ensures that there are enough training datasets to build accurate prediction models relating to gene expression genomic regulation or variant interpretation other features are identification of long noncoding rnas or splice site prediction can also be analyzed as more data becomes available better models will be able to be trained thus resulting in even more precise and accurate predictions of genomic features and functions although deep learning holds enormous promise for advancing new genomics discoveries it should also be implemented mindfully and with appropriate caution deep learning should be applied to biological datasets of sufficient size usually on the order of thousands of samples even though the use of ai and deep learning can solve many problems related to genomic data the use is challenging and not cost effective at all it needs high quality machines and skilled experts but as it was said that – ” if it is worth it then it is nothing to worry about ” but if we succeed in applying the concept of deep learning and ai in genetics with cost effectiveness it will create a history in the world of science and biology and it is possible that humans can reach new heights of genetics and the human genome

10,artificial intelligence ai is intelligence demonstrated by machines as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals leading ai textbooks define the field as the study of “intelligent agents” any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals ai applications include advanced web search engines recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix understanding human speech such as siri or alexa self driving cars e g tesla and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and go as machines become increasingly capable tasks considered to require “intelligence” are often removed from the definition of ai a phenomenon known as the ai effect but as it is said that everything comes at a price the same is the case with ai it has many advantages but at the same time it has disadvantages and one of the most prominent ones is use of ai in wars artificial intelligence is not only a consumer and business centric technology yes companies use ai to automate various tasks while consumers use ai to make their daily routines easier but governments–and in particular militaries–also have a massive interest in the speed and scale offered by ai nation states are already using artificial intelligence to monitor boundaries and defenses militaries are doing more research and development of artificial intelligence ai and are looking to implement ai systems in early august of this year the u s defense advanced research projects agency announced that later in the month a human fighter pilot would face off against an ai algorithm in virtual combat the leading military powers have already made it clear that they want to profit from the opportunities offered by this promising technology many nations like the u s a u k china have already started investing in ai for their military if the nations keep investing their military funds in ai military development then consequences can be devastating and may lead to the elimination of the entire human species the usage of robots who are never tiring and non demanding in wars can be fatal during war times the difficulties that are most faced are shortage of food weapons human resources and tiredness of soldiers but ai solves them all the machines do not need food they are never tired and the loss of human lives can also be prevented if ai will be introduced in wars the wars will become ever ending the powerful nations will try to suppress the weak ones the wars will never end the huge impact of wars will destroy all human civilization even though ai is a revolutionary step in the it and research industry its devastating steps are not far from what is seen if ai is introduced in futuristic wars wars will be unimaginable robotic armies and humanoids will be used in wars which will the robotic armies will invade territories like wild creatures leaving no mercy on anyone this all will lead to only devastation and destruction as years ago in hiroshima and nagasaki nuclear blasts have caused havoc similar havoc will be caused by the use of ai in militaries and wars but the consequences will be far worse than before and they may be as worse as human civilization's elimination from the earth or the consequences can be worse as taking an example of the establishment of robotic territories

11,the big data industry has grown at an incredible rate as businesses realize the importance of insightful data analysis we will compare how big data corresponds to artificial intelligence what are the similarities and what are the differences between them whether any one of them is better than the other or how the combination of both leads to results beyond traditional human capability artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is defined as the ability of a machine to apply logic and reason to analyze interpret inputs and ultimately make decisions it is the recreation of human intelligence with machines there are numerous real world applications of ai systems today a few of them are online chatbots recommendation engines speech recognition computer vision etc we all have ai assistants on our phones like google assistant apple's siri samsung's bixby amazon's alexa and many more applications that are using speech recognition systems online retailers are using recommendation engines to suggest relevant recommendations to customers during the checkout process computer vision has applications within photo tagging in social media radiology imaging in healthcare and self driving cars within the automotive industry big data big data comes into play when the volume of data is too large for traditional data management practices to be effective big data is a field focused on managing a large volume of data from a variety of sources the essence of big data can be broken into “the three v's of big data” volume the amount of data being collected velocity the rate at which data is received and acted upon variety the different forms of data collected structured semi structured and unstructured data sources similarity ai and big data are both data driven technologies differences the difference between artificial intelligence and big data lies in the output of each artificial intelligence analyses inputs to learn and improve its sorting or patterning processes over time using data that it gathers to provide a more accurate solution in contrast big data is the information that is accumulated from various data sources to then be analyzed by artificial intelligence big data and artificial intelligence are often used in conjunction with one another but each fulfills very different roles one is information and the other is the application of that information the collection and storage of large volume data i e big data is used by machine learning models based on these machine learning models artificial intelligence makes decisions comparison ai uses data but its ability to analyze learn from this data make decisions solve complex problems depends upon the quality of information that is fed to the system big data provides this vast of this information to train ai by harnessing big data resources artificial intelligence systems can make more informed decisions provide better user recommendations most big companies like google youtube amazon netflix spotify and many others constantly collect and analyze user interaction data with their platforms maintaining user data security rules then based on these user data they run data models to predict user demand taste and behavioral patterns as a result of which these platforms are able to provide optimized recommendations for what to watch or listen to next google's own feature phone the google pixel has the best camera because it uses ai to improve the quality of the pictures this ai is so good because it was trained on data google got from a trove of images on the internet conclusions big data makes it possible for artificial intelligent ai to reach its fullest potential there is no artificial intelligence without big data however big data and artificial intelligence are interdependent meaning they cannot exist without one another if one is taken out of the picture then another one cannot exist big data and ai are two technologies of posterity which do not compete but complement each other blackcoffer insights indrani chakraborty developer at tcs,35,big data industry grown incredible rate businesses realize importance insightful

12,if i asked what is the one thing that this pandemic taught us i believe in one word it will be adaptability the ability to change upgrade and adapt yourself to the changing circumstances without losing your individuality the crisis caused by covid tested our perseverance strength and adaptability in the best possible way in other words the survival of the fittest has begun the covid has resulted in the shutdown of schools and colleges worldwide and more than billion students are away from the physical classroom as a result education has dramatically changed with the rise of e learning most of the educational institutions universities schools and colleges across the world specifically in india followed the traditional setup of face to face learning in the classroom before the outbreak of deadly coronavirus even though in the last ten years various e learning platforms emerged like byjus unacademy vedantu upgrade and other international e learning platforms like edx udemy coursera but the pandemic and lockdown worked as a catalyst and amplified the speed of the process and boosted the demand of the e learning platform manifold times the platforms like byju's which is now the world's most highly valued ed tech company and have seen a increase in the number of new students using its product according to the company's chief operating officer mrinal mohit the school colleges and universities that were reluctant to change their traditional pedagogical approaches had to shift to an online mode of teaching and learning overnight the teachers students and government are now dependent on this online mode of education and even if we come out of this pandemic e learning and online mode of education is the future fig online teaching is done by robo so what can we do to make the experience of online teaching and learning better and how robots or ai can help in it there is no doubt that e learning is flexible time saving and can revolutionize the education system but there are subsequent challenges as well where we have to work upon to make the user experience better and effective while talking about the challenges the main problems are connectivity the crucial problem students and teachers faced was the internet connectivity issues internet is the most vital part of e learning a stable and good internet connection is compulsory to teach and learn through online mode but poor and unstable network connectivity is the major obstacle specifically in india in learning and teaching online gadgets and technology effective online education is not possible without the right equipment and gadgets the technical glitch we face can interrupt the process of learning therefore we need sustainable efficient and affordable tools to support e learning cost the main problem with e learning is the cost and the maintenance charges it brings with it which is unaffordable for many personal interaction according to the survey i have conducted for writing this article the main hurdle in online education is the personal interaction and connection between a teacher and a student face to face teaching and learning help to build that ecosystem and environment because it is not just about learning the subjects but the network and relationship we build with the teachers and our classmates which makes us the part of the community around which our life revolves as a student and we develop as an individual authenticity as we all know an examination is a crucial part of learning but taking exams through an online mode is of great difficulty it is impossible to monitor so many students by a single teacher through a virtual screen therefore students can easily take help of unethical means to give exams through an online mode hence the relevance of taking exams will get lost if we do not find a solution to this problem digital literacy many people particularly ones from the older generations and others are neither habituated nor exposed to this technology from an early age therefore they cannot teach or learn through online mode efficiently last year due to lockdown many senior school teachers faced a lot of difficulties in teaching online the sudden countrywide lockdown made them shift online without any prior experience hence created a lot of challenges for them adaptability e learning is popular among adults and teenagers but not amongst young kids they are not well trained to learn online they get easily distracted and face way more difficulties learning and understanding the concepts through a virtual screen they need undivided attention and an engaging environment to learn which is not available in an e learning platform health constantly looking at the virtual screen puts a strain on our eyes which causes eye discomfort and vision problems this problem is more severe amongst young kids children have to spend a prolonged period in front of the computer screen in e learning platforms which might affect their eyes in the long run inclusion e learning is not inclusive in many ways most of the e learning platforms do not take into consideration specially abled individuals and if they want to use e learning platforms it is not so user friendly for them copyright issues there is a copyright issue in e learning portals someone can try to record the classes and use them for their benefit a student who has not register for a particular course can sit beside a friend who has enrolled for the same and gain knowledge without paying for it in this way there can be several other misuses of e learning platforms i have conducted a survey where i have collected information from the teachers and students from all age groups who are active users of the e learning platforms the ten points mentioned above are the relevant issues they are facing in an e learning platform so now the question is how can we make their experience better by using ai and robots at first i would start with the copyright issue we can take the help of ai and robots to build systems that can detect the presence of a camera in the room where the student is present this process can prevent any duplication secondly we can use a robot to detect any other individual staring at the screen or taking class notes therefore adopting this kind of method will prevent the copyright issues that we face next comes the point of inclusion as i have already stated most of the e learning platforms do not consider specially abled individuals so to solve this problem we can take the help of the robot to translate the teachings into code languages that they can understand robots can also give them dictations or assist them in writing in this way we can create a more inclusive ecosystem a robot can be an effective tool to overcome the language barrier we can convert the teachings into different languages with the help of a robot then it can reach a larger audience and people can learn in their mother tongue this can be a revolutionizing step to promote diversity another key aspect that we discussed is health by taking the help of robots and ai we can minimize the effects of visual discomfort and reduce the strain on the eyes this can go a long way to protect kids and adults from computer vision syndrome fig interaction with robo in classroom while talking about kids i would bring the point of adaptability which i have mentioned earlier kids need way more attention and an interacting environment to learn and enjoy the learning process therefore e learning portals can take the help of robots to make the learning process more engaging they can develop a technology where the kids will feel that teachers are interacting on one to one basics with them even in the classroom of thirty or forty students this process might help them to grab more keeping the interest in the subject intact and growing since the children are not well trained to use the complicated technology we can make it more simple handy and adaptable but if we want to make e learning portals the future of the education system then we have to keep other things in mind learning is not just about academics building discipline peer to peer relationships teamwork developing a strong sense of ethics integrity communication skills and leadership skills are a part of the learning process hence the e learning portals can use robots or ai to implant this in the learning process to make it wholesome blackcoffer insights dolon biswas praxis business school,71,asked thing pandemic taught word

13,big data as the word suggests means a large amount of data data can be both in structured as well as unstructured format data can be collected from various sources such as mobile phones social media big transactions videos internet of things devices financial instruments like stocks bonds and news with the increasing use of internet the data generated by these devices is also increasing rapidly and this data is helpful to make projections for what is upcoming the use of data is largely dependent on the company analyzing it new technologies such as machine learning deep learning artificial intelligence are data driven technologies large companies use this data to enhance the client experience and execute digital transactions with greater efficiency and minimal mistakes organizations need to understand the values of this data otherwise they would be left behind big data for finance big data is completely revolutionizing the way the stock market used to operate the reaction to any business political news is seen in microseconds even before the common people are aware of it trading firms used different sets of algorithms to extract data from websites much faster than naked eyes investors are relying on quantitative data to make investment decisions this helps to remove the emotional stress before taking any trade the exponential growth in technology is changing the way industries and companies operate the financial sector is usually considered a data driven sector activities such as mergers and acquisitions financial statements accounting and tax statements require a huge amount of data to be cleaned there are trillions if not billions of dollars moving across different markets and continents many firms are responsible for analyzing such data with accuracy and security to create predictions find patterns and create different strategies because systems cannot store such huge amounts of data due to lack of space and security analysts are using cloud services cloud based solutions not only reduce the cost but also help in making the data accessible for anyone in need of it this data can be used to analyze different business models their profitability and create financial models based on them use of big data in finance accurate analysis big data has an important advantage on manpower and that is the accuracy human are subject to make errors which cannot be avoided but on the other hand computers do not make mistakes the importance of accuracy greatly increases when dealing in the financial markets mainly in stocks foreign currency and crypto as well a small change in the number might lead to a huge loss calculated decisions need to be made on the basis of financial and economical numbers such as inflation data manufacturing data monthly cement and auto sales data computers have a greater processing capability but this can only be achieved when data given to the computer is properly structured and made use of efficiently risk management big data helps organization in managing their risks by providing real time insights and the change in customer behavior big data can be used largely to analyze if any attacks are been made to the system it detects any illogical change in the system immediately and thus alerts the officials because it constantly analyses the data coming from the servers which is next to impossible for any human to do big data also reduces the number of errors while trading in the financial markets such as you can set a limit to the position sizing to the order that is to be executed big data can also be used to keep an eye on the liquidity to get better insights of the cash flow and to improve liquidity management it can also be used to analyze the credit risk management system by analyzing transaction history available cash credit score etc frauds in accounting and taxation can be avoided by constantly analyzing the data consumer analytics today consumer is an integral and most prominent part of any business big data helps to analyze the data of these consumers which is generated in huge amounts and give them better service big data can be used for more targeted marketing with faster reactivity companies are trying to understand the needs of the consumer and predict the future behavior generate more leads consumers can be provided with the products that they need and hence using smart marketing strategies we can eventually increase our customer size example if a consumer has less money in his current bank account than the budget he requires annually he can be provided with a short term loan if a consumer is searching for cars online more than his recent searches a car loan will be a good option new products and services big data can be used to make a lot of new products than the conventional ones big data can useful for creating a personalized products to each and every consumer each consumer has different set of need and this need to be taken as an opportunity big data can be used to make quantitative decision that usually had been a difficult task for human being big data can be used to identify the customer goals the situation of the family the risk appetite and propose financial advise tax advisory and wealth management using this data quantitative trading can be implemented using big data as it can analyze large sums of data generated from the stock exchange every second also the sentiment of the market can be analyzed with the help of big data by analyzing blog posts news articles recent searches etc customer support customer is the most important part in any business and hence technology should be used to enhance their satisfaction from the firm large amount of data generated from the consumer can be used to analyze the customer feedback from various sources such as call centre sending emails etc it helps us to identify the problems faced by the consumer and helps us to modify the product or service provided to them technical feedback is much more efficient than paper feedback as personalized questions can be generated for each and every consumer this helps to increase customer loyalty and retain more customers faster data insights articles that is published by any particular newspaper can be analyzed in a few seconds with the help of big data and decisions can be made within a few milliseconds example if a journal publishes an article stating management issues in a particular company and if we are holding equity shares of the company decision would be made in a split second to sell the stock time is an important aspect in stock market and it can cause damage if decisions are slow these are among the few applications of big data in finance big data is and will be helpful to all aspects of any business let it be marketing finance operations or human resource as well around trillion mb of data is generated per day and this data needs to be analyzed to generate more

music composer and ultimately will ai replace my dream job in the future well for a quick answer there are websites like willrobotstakemyjob com to know whether you are likely to get fired due to technology or not so will there be a technological revolution and if yes who will be its victims robot and employment the possibility of such a revolution has always been opposed by claiming that computers can only think linearly and they follow directions and commands that we humans give but this is a misconception because with the advancement of machine learning artificial intelligence is now able to go beyond carrying out instructions and it can now form concepts and act upon them in google was able to train a machine learning algorithm to recognize cat videos on youtube but the algorithm was not taught what cats look like it learned by observation and by making generalizations and models to draw upon like an animal does and was able to develop a universal idea of what a cat face should be hence there will be a wave of the technological revolution which is capable of replacing future jobs for humans but the question is when will it happen there had always been false alarms in the past but according to the latest reports ‘future of work has arrived early due to covid and may lead to million jobs getting replaced in the near future any tasks that can be learned or repetitive jobs are at risk of being wiped out information and data processing administrative tasks and regular manual work will be the primary focus of machines warehouse and manufacturing jobs customer service research data entry accountants taxi drivers factory workers truckers paralegals radiologists are some of the jobs that will get replaced soon telemarketing bookkeeping clerks compensation and benefits managers receptionists proofreaders computer support specialists market research analysts advertising salespeople retail salespeople will be the victims in management fields digital medicines are almost here opening the possibility of getting diagnosed and treated by artificial intelligence by recording users' voices locations facial expressions exercise sleep and texting activity even though a technological revolution can lead to wiping out of a mass number of jobs it will create more new job opportunities some jobs and sectors are going to witness historical growth in the future recent studies show that analytical thinking creativity and flexibility are among the top skills needed over the next five years while data and artificial intelligence content creation and cloud computing are the top emerging professions it will also increase the efficiency of employees thus creating more profit for example email marketing is now one of the most efficient ways of marketing where the employer can automatically analyze the effectiveness of campaigns a technological revolution can also create a revolution in manufacturing which is the “quintessential escalator for developing economies” like any other new technology artificial intelligence and robotics will initially be met with skepticism but eventually being embraced technological or robotics revolution

15,defense is crucial to a nation's well being and progress for this reason every country assigns tantamount importance to it to protect its interests a nation has to guard its land seas and the air with the addition of space recently with the anti satellite missile just like other sectors technology has impacted defense as well continual improvements are being made in the design of guns missiles submarines ships planes and so on at the same time efforts are being made to minimize human loss during wars one of the best ways to do so would be to employ expendable machines that could do the work the concept that enables machines to do so is artificial intelligence the immediate thing that might come to our mind is a terminator like soldier which will completely replace humans however that is not even close to reality because of the difficulties involved at present ai cannot do that level of multitasking cannot react to new and difficult situations and also can be confused by the enemies given below is a wonderful article by lt col ret paul maxwell is the cyber fellow of computer engineering at the army cyber institute at the united states military academy which illustrates this however as the author says ai can be used in maintenance applications to determine if a system is going to fail or needs repair a similar kind of application is to analyze the medical condition of a soldier and predict his operability so that he can be treated for it the best way right now is to enhance the overall power of the armed forces the machines must act as force multipliers assist humans not replace them this is the objective that countries are presently working to achieve let us consider land warfare soldiers have to push into the battlefield face enemy attacks and possibly sustain fatal wounds moreover few terrains are too difficult and dangerous for humans to access this problem can be reduced considerably using the following technologies ugv unmanned ground vehicle and sentry guns ugvs come in various sizes from small bag sized to medium sized tanks this is because of the variety of roles they are employed in the small ones are ideal for reconnaissance purposes mine detection bomb disposal and small assault operations this is because of their small size which makes them difficult to detect and also enables them to access inaccessible places india has already developed daksh for the above purposes another notable example is gladiator ugv in the us the us is also trying to develop ball robots for the same purposes autonomous tanks are useful because they assist the conventional tanks by acting as a security cover while also carrying out assault operations or carrying essential gear the milrem ugv is being used by estonian troops in mali in africa for carrying supplies and ammunition mostly the technology is still under development but once approved it will be very useful to a nation a link with ugv info is given below sentry guns are static devices they have basically powered machine guns that rotate about a fixed point and fire automatically at targets using their cameras and sensors they are very useful when it comes to the defense of a place from invading enemies a battery of these guns can be installed at various points around the specified place thus sentry guns are extremely useful because they prevent the defending soldiers from becoming exposed targets south korea uses this system at the demilitarized zone between north korea and south korea autonomous technologies can also be applied in water there are certain operations such as minesweeping or stand by where there is a high threat to the ships involved for these we can use autonomous boats and ugv unmanned underwater vehicles autonomous boats are useful because they can protect bigger ships that are standing idle or exposed they can also carry out reconnaissance and assault operations the us navy is currently trying to make such boats operational underwater the submarine is the combat vehicle in present times underwater warfare has become more complex due to the adoption of stealth technologies like acoustic dampening and anti submarine technologies which can be deployed from the air this also increases the number of staff on submarines required to handle such situations and increases the threat of significant casualties however the use of uuv would significantly reduce these problems and thus countries like the usa china whose navies are the largest in the world are trying to incorporate this technology to increase their dominance ai has been implemented in aerial attacks very successfully in the form of drones or uavs unmanned aerial vehicle almost all countries have implemented this technology these aircraft are just like remote control planes only a little bigger here ai is used to identify targets on the ground and communicate with the operator india has rustom netra lakshya and various other drones uav's however the us is trying to produce an unmanned fighter jet that can escort manned fighter planes transport aircraft and engage in aerial combat all the above technologies can work either independently or can be operated remotely when they operate independently they collect information from the battlefield using sensors and using ai it makes decisions when used remotely i e operated by a person from a different place they behave pretty much like remote control devices the great advantage of this technology is that human intervention and thus casualty is reduced also the cost of producing such technology is considerably lower than producing manned machines the most significant use involves ‘swarming' which is similar to the swarming of bees around an intruder when deployed in packs they encircle the enemy and devastate them loss of these machines does not cause significant loss they are expendables easily replaceable warfare has a new front nowadays cyber front the recent solar winds hack is a clear example for emphasizing this as the world becomes increasingly digital nations or entities can be called terrorists will look forward to exploiting this to their advantage most of these attacks have been done with one objective extract sensitive and confidential data using this data a country's money can be stolen electrical blackouts may be caused or even worse the country's defense can be paralyzed for facilitating the foreign attack coming to the size of data it is huge in pb processing this kind of volume requires techniques like big data and to identify weak spots in millions of accounts or networks hackers might be using ai and ml machine learning just like them cybersecurity officials have to use ai or ml to predict and simulate cyber attacks and identify weak spots in cybersecurity now it comes down to who uses better technology and techniques ai has to counter ai however there is a concern that applies to all sectors using ai will ai replace humans will it rule us the answer is yes if we use too much ai the same applies in the defense sector also the applications that have been discussed here act as force multipliers as long as humans control them ai should never replace soldiers but perform tasks that are too risky or impossible for humans ai should not be allowed to become too intelligent nor they should be allowed to operate independently machine learning should be confined only to familiarize with battlefield situations not to think ahead of us and act arbitrarily before such a device fires a bullet on its own a human must be there to see that it happens according to his will another concern is hacking what if the enemy hacks these devices such concerns must be addressed by adding multiple layers of encryption or limiting the amount of communication possible take for example a regular ‘nonsmart' washing machine we cannot communicate with it in any other way other than pressing its buttons nor can it do anything else other than washing clothes this could be done with all the unmanned vehicles communication must be restricted to the user and the machine the device should perform only its intended duty if a nation learns to harness and balance the use of technology then not only its defense sector but also all the other sectors will be stronger and ensure the nation's holistic development

16,have you heard the movie big hero it is an animated movie in which this guy named tadashi built ai machine baymax the inflatable healthcare robot which could be very in army camps and place where the medical sector is not up to the mark but there is a plot twist it was later turned into a war machine by his younger brother the whole idea of telling this is that the concept shown in it is now a reality that would come into effect in the coming years ai is something that has drastically put an impact on our ways of working like if we take ourselves a few years back then no one can think of payment doing through the internet or buying things by just watching their pics that is what online shopping is ai is making everything more effective available to all and most importantly it does not have any boundaries the healthcare sector and the knowledge associated are complex health check ups today are not just limited to checking the patient's temperature or asking questions with the amplified number of complex diseases even technology has to get more advance modern tests complex medication processes and restful treatment require high end technologies for better healthcare industry this where ai is making its way through in the medical industry because it can bring a drastic effect on the healthcare sector in many ways – development of radiology tools radiological images obtained by mri machines ct scanners and x rays offer non invasive visibility into the inner workings of the human body but many diagnostic processes still rely on physical tissue samples obtained through biopsies which carry risks including the potential for infection artificial intelligence will enable the next generation of radiology tools that are accurate and detailed enough to replace the need for tissue samples in some cases experts predict making pathology images more precise pathologists provide one of the most significant sources of diagnostic data for providers across the spectrum of care delivery says jeffrey golden md chair of the department of pathology at bwh “seventy percent of all decisions in healthcare are based on a pathology result ” he said somewhere between and percent of all the data in an electronic health record are from a pathology result so the more accurate we get and the sooner we get to the right diagnosis the better we are going to be that is what digital pathology and ai have the opportunity to deliver analytics that can drill down to the pixel level on extremely large digital images can allow providers to identify nuances that may escape the human eye advance wearables and personal devices for monitoring health almost all consumers now have access to devices with sensors that can collect valuable data about their health from smartphones with step trackers to wearables that can track a heartbeat around the clock a growing proportion of health related data is generated on the go collecting and analyzing this data – and supplementing it with patient provided information through apps and other home monitoring devices – can offer a unique perspective into individual and population health artificial intelligence will play a significant role in extracting actionable insights from this large and varied treasure trove of data smartphones as powerful diagnostic tools continuing the theme of harnessing the power of portable devices experts believe that images taken from smartphones and other consumer grade sources will be an important supplement to clinical quality imaging – especially in underserved populations or developing nations the quality of cell phone cameras is increasing every year and can produce images that are viable for analysis by artificial intelligence algorithms researchers in the united kingdom have even developed a tool that identifies developmental diseases by analyzing images of a child's face the algorithm can detect discrete features such as a child's jawline eye and nose placement and other attributes that might indicate a craniofacial abnormality currently the tool can match the ordinary images to more than disorders to provide clinical decision support not just this but ai will be upgrading the health care industry in way more than this completely changing it for ai will begin the new chapter in the health care industry it will change the traditional method of treatment and analysis the doctor will able to treat their patient in a much more effective way as ai will reduce the pressure on them the doctor will be less likely to say “they cannot help them it is too late” to their patient who knows that one day will come and just like in the home where we are using alexa the future will bring virtual assistants with embedded intelligence to the bedside for humans to use for any medical problem many would say that at the end of the day ai is just manmade creation there will be some flaw in it we cannot fully trust them there can be any glitch in it or what doctor can do ai will never be able to do in the modern world with the existence of a pandemic situation ai will be never able to take the place of a doctor but with the assistance of ai a doctor will able to handle the situation more efficiently and with up gradation in modern technology they will be well prepared of a situation like covid hope it will never come in future at last ai will

17,introduction “if anything kills over million people in the next few decades it will be a highly infectious virus rather than a war not missiles but microbes ” bill gates's remarks at a ted conference in right after the world had avoided the ebola outbreak when the new unprecedented invisible virus hit us it met an overwhelmed and unprepared healthcare system and oblivious population this public health emergency demonstrated our lack of scientific consideration and underlined the alarming need for robust innovations in our health and medical facilities for the past few years artificial intelligence has proven to be of tangible potential in the healthcare sectors clinical practices translational medical and biomedical research after the first case was detected in china on december st it was an ai program developed by bluedot that alerted the world about the pandemic it was quick to realise ai's ability to analyse large chunks of data could help in detecting patterns and identifying and tracking the possible carriers of the virus many tracing apps use ai to keep tabs on the people who have been infected and prevent the risk of cross infection by using ai algorithms that can track patterns and extract some features to classify or categorise them so how does ai do that ibm watson a sophisticated ai that works on cloud computing and natural language processing has prominently contributed to the healthcare sector on a global level being a conversational ai since watson has helped in recommending treatments to patients suffering from cancer to ensure that they get the best treatment at optimum costs researchers at google inc showed that an ai system can be trained on thousands of images to achieve physician level sensitivity by identifying the molecular patterns associated with disease status and its subtypes gene expression and protein abundance levels machine learning methods can detect fatal diseases like cancer at an early stage machine learning ml techniques focus mainly on analyzing structured data which can further help in clustering patients' traits and infer the probability of disease outcomes since patient traits mainly include masses of data relating to age gender disease history disease specific data like diagnostic imaging and gene expressions etc ml can extract features from these data inputs by constructing data analytical algorithms ml algorithms are either supervised or unsupervised unsupervised learning helps in extracting features and clustering similar features together that further leads to early detection of diseases clustering and principal component analysis enable grouping or clustering of similar traits together that are further used to maximize or minimize the similarity between the patients within or between the clusters since patient traits are recorded in multiple dimensions such as genes principal component analysis pca creates the apparatus to reduce these dimensions which humans could have not done alone supervised learning considers the outcomes of the subjects together with the traits and further correlates the inputs with the outputs to predict the probability of getting a particular clinical event expected value of a disease level or expected survival time or risk of down's syndrome biomarker panels that are mostly used to detect ovarian cancer have outperformed the conventional statistical methods due to machine learning in addition to this the use of ehrs and bayesian networks which are a part of supervised machine learning algorithms can predict clinical outcomes and mortality respectively unstructured data such as clinical notes and texts are converted into machine readable structured data with the help of natural language processing nlp nlp works with two components text processing and classification text processing helps in identifying a series of disease relevant keywords in clinical notes and then through classification are further categorized into normal and abnormal cases chest screening through ml and nlp has helped find abnormalities in the lungs and provide treatment to covid patients healthcare organizations use nlp based chatbots to increase interactions with patients keeping their mental health and wellness in check deep learning is a modern extension of the classical neural network techniques which helps explore more complex non linear patterns in data using algorithms like convolution neural network recurrent neural network deep belief network and deep neural network which enables more accurate clinical prediction when it comes to genome interpretation deep neural networks surpass the conventional methods of logistics regression and support vector machines sepsis watch is an ai system trained in deep learning algorithms that holds the capability to analyze over million data points to create a patient's risk score and identify the early stages of sepsis another method known as the learning based optimization of the under sampling pattern loupe is based on integrating full resolution mri scans with the convolutional neural network algorithm which helps in creating more accurate reconstructions robotic surgery is widely considered in most delicate surgeries like gynaecology and prostate surgery even after striking the right balance between human decisions and ai precision robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency as they have to be manually operated through a console thus autonomous robotic surgery is on the rise with inventions such as robotic silicon fingers that mimic the sense of touch that surgeons need to identify organs cut tissues etc or robotic catheters that can navigate whether it is touching blood tissue or valve researchers at children's national hospital washington have already developed an ai called smart tissue autonomous robot star which performs a colon anastomosis on its own with the help of an ml powered suturing tool that automatically detects the patient's breathing pattern to apply suture at the correct point an image of star during surgery cloud computing in healthcare has helped in retrieving and sharing medical records safely with a reduction in maintenance costs through this technology doctors and various healthcare workers have access to detailed patient data that helps in speeding up analysis ultimately leading to better care in the form of more accurate information medications and therapies how can it help in biomedical research since ai can analyze literature beyond readability it can be used to concise biomedical research with the help of ml algorithms and nlp ai can accelerate screening and indexing of biomedical research by ranking the literature of interest which allows researchers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses far more precisely and quickly taking it to the next level ai systems like the computational modelling assistant cma helps researchers to construct simulation models from the concepts they have in mind such innovations have majorly contributed to topics such as tumour suppressor mechanisms and protein protein interaction information extraction ai as precision medicine since precision medicine focuses on healthcare interventions to individuals or groups of patients based on their profile the various ai devices pave the way to practice it more efficiently with the help of ml complex algorithms like large datasets can be used to predict and create an optimal treatment strategy deep learning and neural networks can be used to process data in healthcare apps and keep a close watch on the patient's emotional state food intake or health monitoring “omics” refers to the collective technologies that help in exploring the roles relationships of various

human practitioners before during or after sessions the detection and computational analysis of psychological signal project uses ml computer vision and nlp to analyze language physical gestures and social signals to identify cues for human distress this ground breaking technology assesses soldiers returning from combat and recognizes those who require further mental health support in the future it will combine data captured during face to face interviews with information on sleeping eating and online behaviours for a complete patient view stroke identification stroke is another frequently occurring disease that affects more than million people worldwide thrombus in the vessel cerebral infarction is the major about cause of stroke occurrence in recent years ai techniques have been used in numerous stroke related studies as early detection and timely treatment along with efficient outcome prediction can help solve the problem with ai at our disposal large amounts of data with rich information more complications and real life clinical questions can be addressed in this arena currently two ml algorithms genetic fuzzy finite state machine and pca were implemented to build a model building solution these include a human activity recognition stage and a stroke onset detection stage an alert stroke message is activated as soon as a movement significantly different from the normal pattern is recorded ml methods have been applied to neuroimaging data to assist disease evaluation and predicting stroke treatment for the diagnosis patient monitoring today the market for ai based patient monitoring is impressive and monetarily enticing it is evolving with artificial sensors smart technologies and explores everything from brain computer interfaces to nanorobotics companies with their smart watches have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not “patients” an obvious place to start is with wearable and embedded sensors glucose monitors pulse monitors oximeters and ecg monitors with patient monitoring becoming crucial ai finds numerous applications in chronic conditions intensive care units operating rooms emergency rooms and cardiac wards where timeless clinical decision making can be measured in seconds more advances have started to gain traction like smart prosthetics and implants these play an impeccable role in patient management post surgery or rehabilitation demographics laboratory results and vital signs can also be used to predict cardiac arrest transfer into the intensive care unit or even death in addition an interpretable machine learning model can assist anesthesiologists in predicting hypoxaemia events during surgery this suggests that with deep learning algorithms raw patient monitoring data could be better used to avoid information overload and alert overload while enabling more accurate clinical prediction and timely decision making conclusion considering the vast range of tasks that an ai can do it is evident that it holds deep potential in improving patient outcomes to skyrocketing levels using sophisticated algorithms ai can bring a revolution in the healthcare sector even after facing challenges like whether the technology will be able to deliver the promises ethical measures training physicians to use it standard regulations etc the role of ai in transforming the clinical practices cannot be

18,human minds a fascination in itself carrying the potential of tinkering nature with the pixie dust intelligence creating and solving the mysteries and wonders with anything but admiration however no matter how captivating a human mind can be it could sometimes be appalled it could be the hunger or maybe the desire to want more to go beyond and unravel the limitations or maybe something like pure greed humans have never stopped and always keep evolving when it comes to intelligence and this is what makes them the supreme intelligence calls out for supremacy and so what if there was to evolve something that opposed a challenge to the very human minds to their capabilities while making them question their own importance among themselves artificial intelligence came as a revolution havoc when it first came to the light the concept of making machines does work on their own like granting machines –the intelligence the idea of making machines work like humans came back in the s back then people did not believe in such a thing as making a non living thing work think and carry tasks on its own not to mention to actually surpass humans themselves in those skills the facts are it did by the greatest chess player garry kasparov was defeated in a chess game by a machine and this is where exactly a top skilled human lost to a mere machine created by another who by himself could have never defeated him it was a rule of power of betterment of skills and the granted supremacy were ai and machines just tools equipment something that helped an unskilled person with his mind and intelligence creates something that could do the skilled work for him with perfection and precision well initially it was however as time passed as humans got drawn to the puzzle of ai a lot changed human research went deeper and deeper and as a result the machines evolved with it at present ai machines is a growing field as it develops and improves it has become a part of the industrial revolution in industries most of the laborious work that was once taken care of by humans was now replaced by machines naturally with the evolution in machines its precision mass productivity quality control time efficiencies and all the other factors made it a better choice a choice over humans this led to fear a fear of a not so distant future a future where maybe machines will be so evolved that they will take over the need of a human employee leading to unemployment with the population increase around the world it became the new tech threat for the labor market then again… how true is it does ai really oppose a threat will adapting to technology make millions of people lose their jobs will it lead to mass unemployment will the machines really surpass humans will the creation take over the creator no matter how fearful the future with ai may seem in reality it is not that scary truth is ai is the present reality it is the key that holds the power to unlock a whole next level of human evolution technology is growing there was a time where technology was just an idea but today that idea has been implemented it is working and is carried out nobody could stop the advancement and growth of artificial intelligence it is a wave that is already flowing and we as the present generation and the generations to come to have to learn to learn to swim in this flow and avoid drowning many jobs will be replaced by machines as ai evolves it will keep challenging human minds and their skills with the present covid situation contactless cashiers to robots delivering packages have already taken over the usual routine tasks the jobs of secretaries schedulers and book keeper are at risk too manufacturing units agriculture food services retail transportation logistic and hospitality are all a part of the ai affected automation at an estimation it is said that around million jobs especially including manufacturing will be lost to robots as ai robotics d printing and genetics make their way in even the architects medical docs and music composers feel threatened by technology making us question that will ai even edge us out of our brain jobs too now that can be terrifying however as much as machines will be replacing few jobs they will also be creating new jobs with the economic growth innovation and investment around million jobs are said to be generated these newly enhanced jobs are to create benefits and amplify one's creativity strategy and entrepreneurial skills so what is the catch well it is the skills even though ai is creating times more jobs than it is destroying it is the skills that count ai surged in new job opportunities opportunities like senior data scientist mobile application developer and seo specialist these jobs were once never heard of but now with ai it is born however to do these jobs or for its qualification one needs high level skills and to acquire those skills can be an expensive and time consuming task the future generation might be able to cope up with it but the real struggle is to be faced by the present two generations it is the vulnerability between the skill gap and unemployment and the youths are the ones to be crushed the most therefore as the advancement of ai becomes inevitable there remains no choice but to adapt learn equip ourselves and grow with it the companies have to work together to build an ai ready workplace they should collaborate with the government educators and non profit organizations and work together to bring out policies that could help understand the technologies' impacts faster while also providing the employees some security the economic and business planning should be made considerable for minimizing the impact on local jobs and properly maximizing the opportunities the employees should be provided with proper tools to carry along with the new opportunities while acquiring ai based skills for their day to day work new skills should be identified and implemented for the upskilling and continual learning initiatives employees will have to maximize their robotic quotient and learn core skills they will have to adapt to new working models and understand their roles in the coming future howsoever it is not like ai will totally take over control even though ai proves to be a better choice it still has its limitations at present first it is expensive secondly manufacturing machines in bulk is not good for the environment machines are also very high maintenance therefore human labor will often come cheaper and so will be considered over machines underdeveloped countries will find it hard to equip their people with the upskilling and reskilling required for ai workplace and so for ai to play a role in those countries might take years ai can also be risky and unethical as it is hard to figure out who to be held responsible for in cases where an ai went wrong no matter how advanced ai gets there are some skills where humans will always have an upper hand i e soft skills skills like teamwork communication creativity and critical thinking are something that ai has not been able to beat us up to yet and so the value of creativity leadership and emotional intelligence has increased although with machines coming in between humans causing the lack of human to human interaction the humans seem to fade away a little with this era comes the need for good leaders leaders who are capable of handling both machines and humans together the ones who are organized enough to manage the skilled and the unskilled employees while providing the unskilled trainees with proper training leaders who hold profound soft skills and encourage teamwork while working along with machines the ones who are patient calm and optimized in conclusion yes ai and machines are going to be very challenging but there is nothing humans have not overcome adaptation and up gradation are going to be the primary factor for survival as we witness the onset of the th industrial revolution let us buckle up our seats and race along the highway with the essential fuels skills so as to not let ourselves eliminated after all this is an unending race

19,introduction ai is rapidly evolving in the employment sector particularly in matters involving business and finance finance management economics and accounting are now among the most popular university courses globally particularly at the graduate level due to their high employability however the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that according to research jobs in these sectors may be replaced by ai agents in the next years this is due to the nature of the work as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information which machines excel at large complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by ai powered computers than by people algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans in such matters involving industrial work a subsection of artificial intelligence is used namely machine learning machine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence ai in systems which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience it is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programs its improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps which start with the collection of data this data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an iot structure the second and most time consuming step is cleaning preparing and rearranging the data which involves the recognition of outliers trends and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible the third step consists of formatting data which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources step four is where ai comes into place self service data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them the data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern lastly the data is divided into two sets one for training the algorithm and one for analysis there are three types of machine learning supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning the most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning which is based on accurately labeled data the machine is given a collection of information including the outcome of the operation the rest of the information is referred to as ‘input features' which ‘supervises' the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variants in the case of unsupervised learning the machine is not given labeled sets of data to be divided into allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities this method helps with the classifying of such data reinforcement learning comprises experience based learning similar to people they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actions these variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance which is elaborated on in the following passages machine learning in finance and banking there are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking the most common place it is used is to detect any frauds fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year the most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger document forgery and mortgage fraud usually finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization with expanding innovative headway misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters therefore most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactions machine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups it works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses – like the client's record history ip address area and so forth depending on the type of exchange taking place the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decision examples of fraud detection software used by banks include feedzai data visor and teradata machine learning is also used in algorithmic trading portfolio management loan underwriting chatbots and improving customer service algorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and pre modified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value timing and volume an algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long run in contrast to human dealers algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal likewise algorithmic exchanging does not settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires the exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activities in the banking industry organizations access a large number of shopper information with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by people data scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records search for interesting special cases and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection for instance the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information like age pay occupation and the buyer's credit conduct the benefits of machine learning as with any form of revolutionary technology the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages it is been observed that upon correct usage it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior we have also seen several of the largest it conglomerates such as google amazon and microsoft introduce cloud machine learning platforms technology vs human intelligence in terms of business ml can aid businesses by identifying consumer's demands and formulate a pattern based on them allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales it eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms historical data a process visualization tool a flexible analytical environment and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ml architecture the input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor this eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasks in the financial sector machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management algorithmic trading loan underwriting and fraud detection chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security customer support and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ml in banking another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition which entails a system or program that recognizes objects people places and movements in photos it identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithms the downfalls of machine learning with all the benefits of its advancement machine learning is not the most perfect thing there are several disadvantages which are information acquisition time and resources and high errors and wrong interpretations one of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project more issues have to do with the fact that ai requires gigantic informational indexes to train on and these ought to be unbiased and of good quality there can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy it also needs huge resources to work this can mean extra requirements for the computer to work another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations you should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted results conclusion there have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come with excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines in countries like japan mainly computer programs and ai is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors from cleaning the house to depositing money in banks everything is done by ai however ai cannot replace humans in the future humans have several capabilities which even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have these capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving and human connection for example when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle a machine's touch would not be able to soothe a child another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do like computers ai will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less time consuming without humans themselves there is no future for ai blackcoffer insights amara arora and vaanya

20,“anything that could give rise to smarter than human intelligence – in the form of artificial intelligence brain computer interfaces or neuroscience based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world nothing else is even in the same league ” –eliezer yudkowsky ai researcher there is no denying robots and automation are increasingly part of our daily lives just look around the grocery store or the highway they are everywhere this makes us wonder what if ai can replace human intelligence what can we do to make ourselves relevant tomorrow let us try to find the answers to all these questions and more let us first understand what is artificial intelligence – artificial intelligence or ai basically machines displaying intelligence this can be seen from a machine playing chess or a robot answering questions on facebook artificial intelligence can be further broken down into many different types there are ais designed to do specific tasks such as detecting a specific type of cancer however there are also ais that can do multiple tasks such as driving a car there are many types of ais among the top most important fields are machine learning or ml neural network computer vision and natural language processing or nlp machine learning is the idea of machines being able to prove themselves similar to how a human being learns a new skill machine learning also allows for the optimization of an existing skill machine learning is used in many different fields and one such application is entertainment netflix uses machine learning to recommend more shows that you can watch based on the shows that you have already seen neural networks are algorithms that are modeled after the human brain these algorithms think just like we do which can thereby give similar results to what a human being can give artificial neural networks are used in medical fields to diagnose cancers like lung cancer and prostate cancer computer vision is the idea that computers have visions this allows them to see things the way human beings do or potentially better than human beings do depending on the programming camera used etc computer vision is used in autonomous vehicles for navigation from one place to another natural language processing is the idea that computers can listen to what we say an example of this is siri siri is able to listen to our demands process what it means and provide you an answer based on what is researched now that we know what an ai is and what it can do let us talk about the issue will machine replace the human in the future of work ais allow for the automation of jobs thereby replacing what humans already do this means more job loss and the concentration of wealth to the selected few people this could mean a destabilization of society and social unrest in addition to social unrest ai improves over time this means it becomes smarter faster and cheaper to implement and it will be better at doing repetitive things that humans currently do such as preparing fast food it is predicted that ai will improve so much over to years that ai will become super intelligent this means that it will become even smarter than the most intelligent human on earth according to many experts such as elon musk this could cause the end of human civilization ai could potentially start a war against humans burn crops and do all sorts of tragedies once reserved for human functions at that point in theory we can not stop it because ai would have already thought of all the obstacles that will prevent its goal this means that we cannot unplug the machine in effect ai will replace human intelligence but will this happen in next to years no the field of artificial intelligence is sophisticated enough to do many human tasks that humans currently do currently ai is not smart enough to be empathetic to humans and cannot think strategically enough to solve complex problems ai solutions can be expensive and have to go through many different tests and standards to implement it also takes time for ai to improve for example boston dynamics one of the world's top robotics company had a robot in that needed assistance to walk fast forward to not only the robot could walk by itself but it could jump over objects do backflips and so much more in addition to the timing it takes time for the price of any new technological solution to drop to a point where it is affordable for example a desktop computer costs around in but now you can get a significantly more powerful laptop for the exact same price ai will go through the same curve but what happens after those to years will ai make human intelligence obsolete maybe as we have proven earlier ai will become faster better and cheaper as this happens more and more companies will use ai technology to automate more and more jobs to save money increase productivity and most importantly stay competitive as we have demonstrated ai will become better through repetition via the use of machine learning the only difference is that ai will be able to learn faster as time progresses due to the amount of data that is available today it will also be able to learn from other machines or similar machines to learn how to optimize its tasks or new important skills however ai also just not do repetitive and routine tasks better it will also be able to understand emotional intelligence ethics and creativity this seen in three distinct example ibm ibm uses its ibm watson to program the ai to create a movie trailer fox approached ibm and said they have a movie coming out on ai scifi horror they asked ibm if their platform ibm watson could a trailer by reviewing and watching the footage and searching for scary will machine replace the human in the future of work sad or happy or other moments in the movie that provoked quality emotions based on how the machine was programmed to identify such emotions in a quantifiable manner ibm watson was able to generate a trailer for the movie morgan the result a movie trailer created by machines example – google in google demonstrated an ai assistance that could take calls and do simple stuff the ai was able to set up an appointment what was more fascinating was that it was able to understand the nuances of the conversation the receptionist thought it was a human being that was calling her that is a very primitive version of what is possible with this technology eventually it will be able to have conversations just as human beings do making many sales jobs obsolete example – ai generated art in a paris art collective consisting of three students used artificial intelligence to generate a portrait it generated the portrait painting by studying a set of fifteen thousand art images on wiki art it was estimated to be worth between seven thousand to ten thousand dollars the painting sold at an auction for four thirty five thousand us dollars however we cannot for sure say that ai will replace human intelligence this is because we as a society have started asking hard questions and questioning ethics elon musk founded open ai a research lab whose whole purpose is to promote and discover artificial intelligence in a way to benefits humanity in addition to this there are many factors that affect the long term outcome of ai replacing human intelligence like to what degree will other humans allow for ai to take over depending on the field do people even want artificial intelligence to help them or will they prefer a human counterpart while we may not be able to control what happens in the long run we can definitely secure our short term future here are the top five skills that will not become obsolete in the near future strategic and creative thinking the ability to think outside the box is very human there are thousands upon thousands of slightly different possible outcomes that may result from every distinguishable action that the human mind with its ability to judge from experience is programmed for these purposes in a far more sophisticated manner than ai can currently achieve as the billionaire founder of alibaba jack ma famously said – “ai has logic human beings have wisdom” conflict resolution and negotiations with our understanding of the complexities of human related processes and our ability to improvise and judge we are far better equipped to deal with conflicts than robots are ever likely to be will machine replace the human in the future of work emotional intelligence and empathy ai may be able to recognize faces and images but it can rarely successfully read the feelings of those faces humans to lesser or greater degrees are capable of an accurate analysis of emotional subtext with the application of intuition and the use of delicately worded or elusive languages through these methods we are able to properly judge how a person feels interpretation of gray areas robots and computers function well when presented with quantifiable data however once the situation enters a gray area whether this term refers to morals processes or definitions robots are more likely to falter critical thinking humans are capable of responding to more indicators of quality than computers are while an ai system may be able to analyze documents according to the true or false statements made within the

21,“machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make” nick bostrom to put it frankly artificial intelligence will eventually replace jobs workers in a variety of industries from healthcare to agriculture and manufacturing should expect to witness hiring disruptions as a result of artificial intelligence if history has taught us anything it is that disruptive paradigm shifting business ideas not only make a fortune for the innovators but they also build the groundwork for new business models market entrants and job opportunities which will inevitably follow it is true that robots today or in future will eventually replace humans for many jobs but so did innovative farming equipment for humans and horses during the industrial revolution but that does not mean that our jobs as humans will end here we on the other hand will be required to generate and provide value in whole new ways for entirely new business models as a result of these changes according to of the businesses worldwide artificial intelligence can help people overcome critical and challenging problems and live better lives artificial intelligence consultants at work will be more or equally fair according to a whopping of corporate leaders these results demonstrate that artificial intelligence is steadily extending its measures yielding societal benefits and allowing citizens to live more fulfilling lives increase in automation and jobs where humans cannot compete since the advent of industry businesses are moving at a fast pace towards automation be it any type of industry in researchers at oxford university did a study on the future of work they concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines machine learning is responsible for this disruption it is the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence it allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do a research was conducted by the employees of kaggle wherein an algorithm was to be created to take images of a human eye and diagnose an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy here the winning algorithm could match the diagnosis given by human ophthalmologists another study was conducted wherein an algorithm should be created to grade high school essays here too the winning algorithm could match the grade given by human teachers thus we can safely conclude that given the right data machines can easily outperform human beings in tasks like these a teacher might read essays over a year career an ophthalmologist might see eyes but a machine can read a million essays and see a million eyes within minutes thus it is convenient to conclude that we have no chance of competing with machines on frequent high volume tasks tasks where machines do not work but there are tasks where human beings have an upper hand and that is in novel tasks machines cannot handle things they have not seen many times before the fundamental rule of machine learning is that it learns from large volumes of past data but humans do not we have the ability of seemingly connecting disparate threads to solve problems we have not seen before percy spencer was a physicist working on radar during world war where he noticed that the magnetron was melting his chocolate bar here he was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with his knowledge of cooking in order to invent the microwave oven now this sort of cross pollination happens to each one of us several times in a day thus machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations now as we all know that around of talented professionals believe that soft skills such as human interactions and fostering relationships matter much more than hard skills in being successful in managing a workplace perhaps these are the kind of tasks that machines can never compete with humans at also creative tasks the copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab customers' attention and will have to stand out of the crowd business strategy means finding gaps in the market and accordingly working on them since machines cannot outperform humans in novel tasks it will be humans who would be creating these campaigns and strategies human contact would be essential in care giving and educational related work responsibilities and technology would take a backseat health screenings and customer service face to face communication would advocate for human contact with artificial intelligence playing a supporting role so what does this mean for the future of work the future state of any single job lies in the answer to one single question to what extent is the job reducible to tackling frequent high volume tasks and to what extent does it involve tackling novel situations today machines diagnose diseases and grade exam papers over the coming years they are going to conduct audits they are going to read boilerplate from legal contracts but does that mean we are not going to be needing accountants and lawyers wrong we are still going to need them for complex tax structuring for path breaking litigation it will only get tougher to get these jobs as machine learning will shrink their ranks amazon has recruited more than robots in its warehouses to help move goods and products around more effectively and its warehouse workforce has expanded by more than people humans pick and pack goods amazon has over products on its “shelves” while robots move orders throughout the enormous warehouses therefore reducing “the amount of walking required of workers making amazon pickers more efficient and less exhausted ” furthermore because amazon no longer requires aisle space for humans the robots enable amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush hour traffic ” more inventory under one roof offers better selection for customers and a higher density of shelf space equals more inventory under one roof kodak vs instagram kodak once an undisputed giant of the photography industry had a share in the usa market in and by they were employing people but in the year they had a net worth of negative billion and they had to declare bankruptcy why because they failed to predict the importance of exponential trends when it comes to technology on the other hand instagram a digital photography company started in with employees and later they were sold to facebook for billion this is so ironic because kodak pioneered digital photography and actually invented the first digital camera but unfortunately thought of it as a mere product and did not pay attention towards it and this created the problem we live in an era of artificial intelligence ai which has given us tremendous computing power storage space and information access we were given the spinning wheel in the first electricity in the second and computers in the third industrial revolution by the exponential growth of technology airbnb and its breakthrough idea airbnb which is a giant start up and is known for enabling homeowners to rent out their homes and couches to travellers for example “is now creating a new artificial intelligence system that will empower its designers and product engineers to literally take ideas from the drawing board and convert them into actual products almost instantly ” this might be a significant breakthrough whether you are a designer engineer or other type of technologist differences that automation brings onto the table there are three key changes that automation can bring about at the macro level changes in capability demand gender imbalance in workforce redeployment firm reorganization sectors that might be in trouble artificial intelligence is not just a fad tractica a market research firm published a report in that predicted “annual global revenue for artificial intelligence products and services will expand from million in to billion by a fold increase over that time span ” as a result it is the it industry's fastest growing segment of any size ” the reduction in need for people as a result of artificial intelligence and related technologies which resulted in job layoffs was a cause of fear in india alone job losses in the it sector have reportedly reached in the last year owing to the integration of new and advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning most of the it companies such as infosys wipro tcs and cognizant have reduced their employee base in india and are recruiting less while engaging more personnel in the united states and investing heavily in “centres of innovation ” artificial intelligence and data science which are currently the trending aspects that require fewer people and are primarily located abroad are not helping the prospects of local employees another factor is that the computer industry is continuously growing and would develop to a size of two million workers unfortunately it is a drop in the bucket compared to what robots are doing to information technology's less skilled brothers large e commerce sites that used to be operated by armies of people are now manned by robots

to for efficiency this is a victory but a disaster for job prospects concluding remarks internal re skilling and redeployment of staff is a critical requirement of the hour artificial intelligence has

influence on individuals and their occupations will only be told over time it is up to us to upskill ourselves and look for ways to stay current with the industry's current trends and demands so will machines be able to take over many of our jobs the answer is a resounding yes however for every job that is taken over by robots there will be an equal number of positions available for people to do some of these human vocations will be artistic in nature others will necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities humans and machines can form symbiotic relationships assisting each other

22,introduction where is this disruptive technology taking us take it or leave it disruptive technology always creates new jobs much more than depleted jobs you might notice certain jobs disappearing but those jobs are the jobs that transform humans to robots to machines and the technology is creating machines to replace them technology creates the data analysis tools to manipulate and create custom scenarios using artificial intelligence ai big data and machine learning ml algorithms to predict and drive consumer behavior data analytics tools such as google analytics and others are available today for free and if used correctly can help organizations save millions maybe billions of dollars of sales and marketing how machine will replace humans before i go on i think it is best to level set on what constitutes machines in the context of this article machines describe computers and computerized equipment like robots that have been programmed to learn sometimes like humans occasionally we call this artificial intelligence ai other times we call this machine learning and still other times we call this robotics and yes these are technically different things these bots are more efficient than humans in some specific domains and are growing smarter with each passing day they can do some really tough tasks which are considered difficult for any human being but within the broad discussion related to the future of work these are totally interrelated factory floors deploy robots that are increasingly driven by machine learning algorithms such that they can adjust to people working alongside them a machine can work efficiently only it has abundant data and information about the work which is being imparted daily to them but with every forward step advancement in technology a threat is proliferating a threat of being replaced on our work front every passing day is sealing some jobs for humans all over the globe similarly ai is being used to turn hand drawn sketches done by humans into digital source code role of machines in companies and its future companies are clearly developing their ai and robotics expertise with the idea that through these technological innovations they will be able to cut costs increase efficiencies offer new value propositions execute new business models or all of the above of course it is not just machines and creatives working together either in another example amazon has employed more than robots in its warehouses to efficiently move things around while it has increased its warehouse workforce by more than humans in amazon's case do the picking and packing of goods while robots move orders around the giant warehouses essentially cutting “down on the walking required of workers making amazon pickers more efficient and less tired ” plus the robots “allow amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rush hour traffic because they no longer need aisle space for humans the greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof which means better selection for customers ” why machines can replace humans during the next few decades or maybe sooner the notion of work and whether it is handled by a human or a virtual being will hinge on predictability as they are starting to do today machines will manage the routine while humans take on the unpredictable – tasks that require creativity problem solving and flexibility in this context robotics should be seen not only as a means to improve operations efficiency but also to improve the quality of life for workers although it is obvious that human factors involved in a work activity impact job automation it is also true that highly repetitive tasks—and even mechanical ones—are ideal for robots besides greater efficiency and speed automation leads to a lower risk of accidents greater control and autonomy and above all fewer costs for organizations are machines more diligent than humans although artificial intelligence and machine learning make us believe that robots are endowed with superior intelligence in fact they do not yet have the ability to learn from experience and to respond to unknowns so as things stand however much processing speed and automatic learning a robot has it does not beat factors innate to the human brain humans are still a very essential part of the process think about delivering services to a client most customer challenges are routine but humans play a very important role in addressing new issues solving them the first time they appear and then consolidating the process into the system machines vs humans – which is premium while machines and humans are placed in proximity robots can be expensive but this does not apply to all types especially those based on robotic process automation rpa where the development process incorporates algorithms that significantly reduce costs moreover think of how domestic robots—be it a vacuum cleaner a lawn mower or a pool cleaner—are increasingly part of our daily lives this level of consumption that robotics has attained makes it affordable to automate tasks in modern homes to obtain greater control security and comfort man and machines together the division between humans and machines has been clear – i'm here the machine is there – but that boundary is getting fuzzier smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly with our bodies making up for lost limbs or providing additional strength stability or resilience as seen in exoskeletons donned by assembly line workers we use our smartphones symbiotically but what if they were integrated directly into our bodies think a smartphone in the form of a contact lens capable of transparently delivering augmented reality images straight to the brain think it sounds like science fiction think again the first prototypes have already been built soon brain computer interfaces could become seamless as well creating a new synergistic relationship between the cloud and us at that point the question of who knows what would be moot you ask me a question and i know the answer sometimes that answer will be stored in my own neural circuitry but most of the time it would come from the connection of my neurons to the web our brain's decision process is influenced by the way it has been “educated” by the cultural context these external factors are influencing our decision processes to the point that in certain situations we can legitimately claim that influence has been so strong that our brains cannot be held accountable for the choices made the point i'm trying to make is that we humans are in symbiosis with our cultural environment and the tools – both physical and conceptual – that we have been taught to use my guess is that the transformation will be subtle conclusion practically speaking robots growing to the point that they take over the world and then start creating smarter better robots are impractical and should not even be a concern none of this is expected in the near future not by a long shot if you have been to an atm waited for a pc to boot up after a catastrophic failure or had a game crash on your x box just when you were about to reach a checkpoint you understand that we are not in a world where machines do everything perfectly right before they can take over all of our jobs they need to be able to do theirs' flawlessly until then we can depend on humans to mess up our lives this is not a win or lose situation we are going to wind up as a partner to our smarter machines and that partnership will be fostered by our augmentation through technology machines will play an essential role in this augmentation and as with any successful technology they will fall below our level of perception in the end the revolution will be silent and invisible blackcoffer insights swapna g nivashiniya r sri manakula vinayagar engineering college smvec puducherry,59,introduction disruptive technology taking leave disruptive

23,in future or in upcoming years humans and machines are going to work together in every field of work in upcoming days machines will be the need for every human being machines ai technology will do the work which humans are incapable of doing machines will partner and co operate with humans according to the professor at the university of washington he explained that as a result of ai there will be more demand for existing jobs and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today human workers and machines will work together flawlessly complementing each other machines will learn to carry out easier tasks such as following processes or crunching data they will also help the humans while difficult machines or ai will create a great job opportunities for humans in future john kelly ll executive vice president of ibm once said that “man and machines working together always beat or make a better decision than a man or a machine independently ” in future the three sectors of our country like agriculture sector industrial sector and service sector are going to utilize the machines so that their work becomes not difficult as of now we can only see that for agriculture purposes various kinds of machines are used which we called as a modern farming method some major technologies machines that are harvest automation autonomous tractors seeding and weeing and drones as a result farms can do agriculture peacefully in the industrial sector also humans and machines are working together to increase production various types of machines are used in industries such as packing machines loading machine etc humans provide instructions to the machines and maintain the management in the company soon robots machines will assist doctors with surgeries for instance a doctor at remote location could direct a surgical robot to perform an open heart surgery but the approaches option and decision will be left to experience and wisdom of the doctor not the robot what do you think of machines if they will make humans less or more in the field machines will push human professionals up the skillset ladder into uniquely human skills such as creativity social abilities empathy and sense making which machines cannot automate as a result machines will make the workplace more not less for humans however humans have to learn new skills throughout their lives it is said that in the future of process oriented tasks will be done by machines quantitative reasoning tasks will be done approximately by humans and by machines while humans will continue to do more than of cross functional reasoning tasks according to harvard research machines algorithms can read diagnostic scans with accuracy humans can do it with accuracy together it will be accurate human machine collaboration enables companies to interact with employees and customers in the novel more effective ways smart machines are helping humans to expand their abilities in three ways they can amplify our cognitive strengths interact with customers and employees to free us from higher level tasks and embody human skills to extend our physical capabilities in the research it was found that companies achieve the most significant performance improvement when humans and machines work together new machine systems have beyond human cognitive abilities which many of us fear could potentially dehumanize the future of work machines will indeed automate most repetitive and physical tasks and part of quantitative tasks such as programming and even data science according to d e shaw group and professor at the university of washington explained that as a result of machines there will be more demand for existing jobs and new jobs will be created that are unimaginable today this is similar to how we could not imagine a web app developer decades ago and now millions make a living doing that today machines are good at doing tasks with speed precision and accuracy but machines are not very good at responding to unknown situations or making judgments that part will be left to humans hence the need for both humans and machines will be there in the future humans and machines have divergent skill sets that when combined can transform the way we work machines have already infiltrated every aspect of our lives and we must learn to live with them in the future human workers will interact more

24,everything you need to know about the future of neural networks neural networks are arguably the technological development with the most potential currently on the horizon through neural networks we could feasibly handle almost any computational or contemplative task automatically and someday with greater processing power than the human brain for now neural networks are still in their infancy but already they are an impressive technology responsible for tremendous breakthroughs in everything from speech recognition to medical diagnoses the question is where does it go from here how neural networks work today let us start by talking about how neural networks or neural nets work today in their current form neural nets are computer programs that are assembled from thousands to millions of units each of which is designed to function as an artificial neuron when being “trained ” a neural network is typically fed information allowing it to recognize patterns like spotting familiar faces in photos or identifying the correct way to hit a tennis ball with feedback neural networks then work to modify the way they processed the problem “learning” how to do better over long periods of time when done training neural nets can solve a wide variety of different problems they can notice deviations in historical patterns proactively so you can receive alerts on new events relevant to your business they can automatically recognize trigger points in a pattern like picking a face out of a photo or diagnosing a medical condition and they can perform complex operations without supervision like when playing a game key strengths of neural nets there are several key strengths of neural nets that make them a favorite choice of ai developers performance on problems with many variables for a problem with a strict set of rules and requirements and with constrained inputs it is easy for a machine to work out the answer the go to example here is a calculator the rules of mathematics are never broken and are relatively simple to follow input two variables and two real numbers and you can get their sum easily but identifying speech patterns or diagnosing illnesses require far more variables machines need to “understand” not only what they are looking for but how it is differentiated from the noise and how it might be influenced in different ways neural nets are ridiculously good at solving these big problems—sometimes even better than humans feature engineering neural nets are also incredibly good at figuring out the correct features to ascribe to a problem known as feature engineering let us say you are trying to teach an algorithm how to play and win a game of go the way google did go is a game with practically limitless move possibilities and no clear way of determining whether a move is “good” or “bad” especially in the early game for the machine to learn effectively it must be able to learn how to identify what makes a move more or less likely to get the machine closer to victory neural nets can do this they can create new categories for consideration and apply them to their work applicability neural nets also have the power of flexibility once established they can be applied to almost anything whether it is helping people spot the issues interfering with their productivity or improving air traffic patterns for smoother flights the core functionality of a neural net is to learn something efficiently so if you have a system that can learn to recognize patterns it could feasibly recognize patterns in almost any domain key weaknesses of neural nets they said that some key weaknesses prevent neural nets from seeing full range applications data requirements for starters all neural nets must go through a “learning” period where they start to recognize patterns and refine themselves while we are able to “teach” machines more efficiently than ever before there is still a massive data requirement before those algorithms can start to be effective depending on the application this could take discrete sets of data or more this could substantially increase the time it takes to make a neural net effective or limit possible applications expensiveness neural nets are also expensive and time consuming to develop the computational processes needed to handle all those variables and all those incoming sets of data demand cpu and gpu power beyond the scope of a normal system this makes it a discouraging endeavor for some engineers and drives up the price of a functional system making it harder to use for your intended purposes difficulty and blindness as you might imagine the realities of developing a neural net are much more in depth and complicated than can be implied with a simple overarching definition it is incredibly hard to learn how to develop a neural net and many engineers who begin the journey eventually drop out of the running on top of that because of the intricacies of neural nets we often do not have transparency to see how our algorithms are coming to their conclusions we can determine whether their findings are accurate but we cannot see exactly how they came to those answers which makes it even more mystifying—even to professionals long term potential neural nets have already been responsible for significant advancements in the realm of ai but in terms of long term potential they may not have as much power as other possibilities like kernel methods or even classical ai there is a hard limit to how efficient or complicated neural nets can get and that upper limit is discouraging to many researchers what is in store for the future with all those strengths fueling the future of neural nets and all those weaknesses complicating things what could the future hold for this incredible technology integration the weaknesses of neural nets could easily be compensated if we could integrate them with complementary technology like symbolic functions the hard part would be finding a way to have these systems work together to produce a common result—and engineers are already working on it sheer complexity everything has the potential to be scaled up in terms of power and complexity with technological advancements we can make cpus and gpus cheaper and or faster enabling the production of bigger more efficient algorithms we can also design neural nets capable of processing more data or processing data faster so it may learn to recognize patterns with just examples instead of unfortunately there may be an upper limit to how advanced we can get in these areas—but we have not reached that limit yet so we will likely strive for it in the near future new applications rather than advancing vertically in terms of faster processing power and more sheer complexity neural nets could and likely will also expand horizontally being applied to more diverse applications hundreds of industries could feasibly use neural nets to operate more efficiently target new audiences develop new products or improve consumer safety—yet it is criminally underutilized wider acceptance wider availability and more creativity from engineers and marketers have the potential to apply neural nets to more applications obsolescence technological optimists have enjoyed professing the glorious future of neural nets but they may not be the dominant form of ai or complex problem solving for much longer several years from now the hard limits and key weaknesses of neural nets may stop them from being pursued instead developers and consumers may gravitate toward some new approach—provided one becomes accessible enough with enough potential to make it a worthy successor regardless of what your business goals are there is a good chance neural nets will be able to help you achieve them—if not now then in the very near future despite the shortage of developers companies and engineers are working constantly to refine their neural net efforts which means we are in store for a “golden age” of neural networks at least temporarily it is hard to say whether neural net development will continue indefinitely or whether some new more efficient technology will take its place but either way this breakthrough in the field of ai deserves your attention conclusion many big tech companies today are receiving tons of data from their users and when it comes down to profit and power or the greater good of society it is human nature to go for the former instead especially if you are in a position to choose we live in times where our attention is being capitalized constantly we must live smarter and act rationally to prevent surrendering our lives over to these short bursts of dopamine and expedient and trivial acts we can only hope that as we progress into the upcoming decades the people who are in control of the decisions that these companies make will be for the betterment of society and civilization as a whole and that our data will be for building systems that serve us make us more productive and instead of looking for ways to grab our attention build products that can provide value and meaning to our lives blackcoffer insights monica v sns

25,machine learning techniques may have been used for years but recently there has been an explosion in their applications in fact in a recent q earnings call google ceo sundar pichai said “machine learning is a core transformative way by which we are re thinking how we are doing everything ” and they are far from the only business making that claim in the past successful use of machine learning algorithms required bespoke algorithms and huge r d budgets but all that is changing ibm watson microsoft azure amazon and alibaba all launched turnkey cloud based machine learning saas solutions in at the same time startups like idibon metamind dato and monkeylearn have built machine learning products that companies can take advantage of gartner already puts machine learning at the top of its hype curve and no machine learning will not replace all of your employees with computers or suddenly double your revenue but that does not mean that it cannot give every business a competitive advantage there are plenty of business processes that can significantly benefit from machine learning so how does machine learning change the way businesses operate fig machine learning techniques for business bigger upfront costs first thing's first machine learning needs training data and training data costs money especially training data labeled by humans let me explain to make machine learning work for business the algorithm needs to see lots and lots of examples of what it is supposed to be doing if you want an algorithm to tell you if a sales lead is good you need to show it lots and lots of examples of good sales leads and bad sales leads if you want an algorithm to tag the support tickets you need to show it many examples of support tickets if you localize your algorithm to a new language you probably need to collect lots of examples in that language in some instances a company may have those training sets in house for example a bunch of disqualified or qualified leads but say you have not labeled each of your support tickets as they have come in over the year you would need to have people either in house or en masse via a data enrichment platform label those tickets the machine will then look at those judgments and start finding connections and patterns it can learn from much lower ongoing costs machine learning is much cheaper and more efficient than people when it works well the downside is that it often works well in percent of the cases and badly in percent of the cases and lowering the percent error rate is hard if not impossible but even an percent accurate algorithm can save you a lot of money because good machine learning algorithms know where they are accurate and where they are more likely to have errors smart companies take the cases where the algorithm has high confidence and uses those directly while sending low confidence cases to humans banks have been doing this for years when you put a check in an atm an algorithm tries to decipher the numbers on the check if you have really sloppy handwriting or the ink is smudged the algorithm passes the task to a human this design pattern saves banks lots of money while preserving a very high level of accuracy your costs will drop over time a huge benefit of machine learning is that it can turn part of your variable cost into more of a fixed cost if you use humans to handle cases where that algorithm is struggling you are creating the perfect training data to feed into your algorithm this is a well studied technique called active learning it turns out that training data labels collected on cases where the algorithm has low confidence help the algorithm learn much much more efficiently as the algorithm becomes increasingly more accurate the unit economics of your business process become better and as machine learning becomes able to handle more cases the expensive humans are only called in on the toughest rarest situations that means you use the best of both human and machine intelligence in tandem leveraging the speed and reliability of computers for the easy judgments and the fluency and expertise of humans for the difficult ones and if that sounds like smart

26,elearning as technology becomes more affordable in higher education but having a big barrier in the cost of developing its resources deep learning using artificial intelligence continues to become more and more popular and having impacts on many areas of elearning it offers online learners of the future intuitive algorithms and automated delivery of elearning content through modern lms platforms this paper aims to survey various applications of deep learning approaches for developing the resources of the elearning platform in which predictions algorithms and analytics come together to create more personalized future elearning experiences in addition deep learning models for developing the contents of the elearning platform deep learning framework that enable deep learning systems into elearning and its development benefits future trends of deep learning in elearning the relevant deep learning based artificial intelligence tools and a platform enabling the developer and learners to quickly reuse resources are clearly summarized thus deep learning has evolved into developing ways to re purpose existing resources that can mitigate the expense of content development of future elearning it is natural to wonder where you might get ai tools to avoid the time and expense of developing your own do not worry about the advert of aiaas or “ai as a service” even small education or learning development professionals can purchase the license of ai tools and components however such types of tools cannot be useful for every e learning ecosystem but may offer some enticing benefits such as adding standard ai tasks logic decision making to your toolbox here are some of the aiaas tools and platforms offered by famous tech giants most of which are cloud based microsoft azure cloud based ai services that can be used to build and manage ai applications like image recognition or bot based apps ibm's watson cloud based ai services that can be integrated into your applications to store and manage your own data google's tensor flow an end to end open source machine learning platform amazon web services offers a wide range of products and services on amazon's cloud there are other aiaas platforms such as datarobot petuum and ho which shows that the field is expanding ai will probably not make human workers obsolete at least not for a long time to put some of your fears to bed the robots are probably not coming for your jobs at least not yet given how artificial intelligence has been portrayed in the media in particular in some of our favorite sci fi movies it is clear that the advent of this technology has created fear that ai will one day make human beings obsolete in the workforce after all as technology has advanced many tasks that were once executed by human hands have become automated it is only natural to fear that the leap toward creating intelligent computers could herald the beginning of the end of work as we know it but i do not think there is any reason to be so fatalistic a recent paper published by the mit task force on the work of the future entitled “artificial intelligence and the future of work ” looked closely at developments in ai and their relation to the world of work the paper paints a more optimistic picture rather than promoting the obsolescence of human labor the paper predicts that ai will continue to drive massive innovation that will fuel many existing industries and could have the potential to create many new sectors for growth ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs while ai has made major strides toward replicating the efficacy of human intelligence in executing certain tasks there are still major limitations in particular ai programs are typically only capable of “specialized” intelligence meaning they can solve only one problem and execute only one task at a time often they can be rigid and unable to respond to any changes in input or perform any “thinking” outside of their prescribed programming humans however possess “generalized intelligence ” with the kind of problem solving abstract thinking and critical judgment that will continue to be important in business human judgment will be relevant if not in every task then certainly throughout every level across all sectors there are many other factors that could limit runaway advancement in ai ai often requires “learning” which can involve massive amounts of data calling into question the availability of the right kind of data and highlighting the need for categorization and issues of privacy and security around such data there is also the limitation of computation and processing power the cost of electricity alone to power one supercharged language model ai was estimated at million another important limitation of note is that data can itself carry bias and be reflective of societal inequities or the implicit biases of the designers who create and input the data if there is bias in the data that is inputted into an ai this bias is likely to carry over to the results generated by the ai there has even been a bill introduced into congress entitled the algorithmic accountability act with the goal of forcing the federal trade commission to investigate the use of any new ai technology for the potential to perpetuate bias based on these factors and many others the mit cci paper argues that we are a long way from reaching a point in which ai is comparable to human intelligence and could theoretically replace human workers entirely provided there is an investment at all levels from education to the private sector and governmental organizations—anywhere that focuses on training and upskilling workers—ai has the potential to ultimately create more jobs not less the question should then become not “humans or computers” but “humans and computers” involved in complex systems that advance industry and prosperity this paper is a fascinating read for anyone hoping to dive deeper into ai and the many potential directions in which it may lead ai is becoming standard in all businesses not just in the world of tech a couple of times recently ai has come up in conversation with a client or an associate and i'm noticing a fallacy in how people are thinking about it there seems to be a sense for many that it is a phenomenon that is only likely to have big impacts in the tech world in case you had not noticed the tech world is the world these days do not ever forget when economist paul krugman said in that “by or so it will become clear that the internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's ” you definitely do not want to be behind the curve when it comes to ai in fact of leading businesses already have ongoing investments in ai technologies more than half of businesses that have implemented some manner of ai driven technology report experiencing greater productivity ai is likely to have a strong impact on certain sectors in particular medical the potential benefits of utilizing ai in the field of medicine are already being explored the medical industry has a robust amount of data which can be utilized to create predictive models related to healthcare additionally ai has shown to be more effective than physicians in certain diagnostic contexts automotive we are already seeing how ai is impacting the world of transportation and automobiles with the advent of autonomous vehicles and autonomous navigation ai will also have a major impact on manufacturing including within the automotive sector cybersecurity cybersecurity is front of mind for many business leaders especially considering the spike in cybersecurity breaches throughout attacks rose during the pandemic as hackers capitalized on people working from home on less secure technological systems and wi fi networks ai and machine learning will be critical tools in identifying and predicting threats in cybersecurity ai will also be a crucial asset for security in the world of finance given that it can process large amounts of data to predict and catch instances of fraud e commerce ai will play a pivotal role in e commerce in the future in every sector of the industry from user experience to marketing to fulfillment and distribution we can expect that moving forward ai will continue to drive e commerce including through the use of chat bots shopper personalization image based targeting advertising and warehouse and inventory automation ai can have a big impact on the job search if you are moving forward with the hope that a hiring manager may give you the benefit of the doubt on a small misstep within the application you might be in for a rude awakening ai already plays a major role in the hiring process so much so that up to of resumes are rejected by an automated applicant tracking system or ats before they even reach a human being in the past recruiters have had to devote considerable time to poring over resumes to look for relevant candidates data from linkedin shows that recruiters can spend up to hours looking over resumes for one successful hire increasingly however resume scanning is being done by ai powered programs in of hiring managers stated that ai was making their jobs easier despite the increasing prevalence of automation and algorithms in the hiring process many have been critical of the use of certain types of ai by hiring managers based on the charge that it can perpetuate and ever create more bias in hiring one particular example is illustrated by hirevue a startup whose initial services included technology that aimed to use facial recognition software and psychology to determine the potential effectiveness of a candidate in a certain role the electronic privacy information center filed a lawsuit with the federal trade commission alleging that this software had the potential to perpetuate bias and prejudice hirevue discontinued the use of facial recognition software in early and now uses audio analysis and natural language processing it is clear that the use of certain types of ai in the hiring process will likely be controversial as new technology develops however if potential employers are using ai to process your application there is no reason that you cannot be utilizing similar technology to your advantage jobscan is an excellent resource that provides similar resume scanning to what would be used by a hiring manager by comparing your resume to a job description jobscan will give you information on how to tweak your resume so that it is a good match for a certain position with the goal of “beating” an applicant tracking system ats jobseer is a browser add on and another great ai based tool for those on the job market based on a scan of your resume as well as keywords and skills related to your desired jobs jobseer will help match you with the job listings that best fit your experience for each listing you get a rating based on how well you are aligned with the particular posting as well as recommendations of skills to add to better position your resume and experience rezi now as a disclaimer i would never encourage you to turn your resume writing over to a bot but rezi is an awesome ai based resume builder that includes templates to help you design a resume that is sure to check the boxes when it comes to applicant tracking systems this is a great jumping off point to kickstart a new resume another great way to use this type of tool is to generate a new resume and compare it to your current resume to see how it stacks up and identify some areas for improvement ai is also a great place to focus your energy if you are looking to upskill in your career or make your professional profile more competitive in the job market especially when you consider that ai will have such far reaching impacts across many industries ai and machine learning are at the top of many lists of the most important skills in today's job market jobs requesting ai or machine learning skills are expected to increase by in the next five years if you would like to expand your knowledge base in this arena consider some of the great free online course offerings that focus on ai skills if you are tech savvy it would be wise to dive deep and learn as much as you can about interacting in the ai space if your skills lie elsewhere it is important to recognize that ai will have a big impact and to the extent of your abilities you should try to understand the fundamentals of how it functions in different sectors ai is definitely here to stay whether we like it or not personally i do not think we have anything to be afraid of the best way to move forward is to be aware of and adapt to the new technology around us ai included this article

securing your devices and networks encrypt your data various publicly available tools have taken the rocket science out of encrypting and decrypting email and files data encryption is not just for technology geeks modern tools make it possible for anyone to encrypt emails and other information “encryption used to be the sole province of geeks and mathematicians but a lot has changed in recent years in particular various publicly available tools have taken the rocket science out of encrypting and decrypting email and files gpg for mail for example is an open source plug in for the apple mail program that makes it easy to encrypt decrypt sign and verify emails using the openpgp standard and for protecting files newer versions of apple's os x operating system come with filevault a program that encrypts the hard drive of a computer those running microsoft windows have a similar program this software will scramble your data but will not protect you from government authorities demanding your encryption key under the regulation of investigatory powers act which is why some aficionados recommend truecrypt a program with some very interesting facilities which might have been useful to david miranda ” explains john naughton in an article for the guardian backup your data one of the most basic yet often overlooked data protection tips is backing up your data basically this creates a duplicate copy of your data so that if a device is lost stolen or compromised you do not also lose your important information as the u s chamber of commerce and insurance company nationwide points out “according to nationwide of small businesses do not have a disaster recovery plan the problem with this is the longer it takes you to restore your data the more money you will lose gartner found that this downtime can cost companies as much as an hour ” the cloud provides a viable backup option while you should use sound security practices when you are making use of the cloud it can provide an ideal solution for backing up your data since data is not stored on a local device it is easily accessible even when your hardware becomes compromised “cloud storage where data is kept offsite by a provider is a guarantee of adequate disaster recovery ” according to this post on techradar twitter techradar anti malware protection is a must scammers are sneaky sometimes malware is cleverly disguised as an email from a friend or a useful website malware is a serious issue plaguing many computer users and it is known for cropping up in inconspicuous places unbeknownst to users anti malware protection is essential for laying a foundation of security for your devices “malware short for malicious software is software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer without your consent malware includes computer viruses worms trojan horses spyware scareware and more it can be present on websites and emails or hidden in downloadable files photos videos freeware or shareware however it should be noted that most websites shareware or freeware applications do not come with malware the best way to avoid getting infected is to run a good anti virus protection program do periodic scans for spyware avoid clicking on suspicious email links or websites but scammers are sneaky sometimes malware is cleverly disguised as an email from a friend or a useful website even the most cautious of web surfers will likely pick up an infection at some point ” explains clark howard twitter clarkhoward fig protect your computer from viruses make your old computers' hard drives unreadable much information can be gleaned through old computing devices but you can protect your personal data by making hard drives unreadable before disposing of them “make old computers' hard

access when you do need to perform tasks as an administrator always follow security procedures ” twitter indianauniv use “passphrases” rather than “passwords ” what is the difference “…we recommend you use passphrases–a series of random words or a sentence the more characters your passphrase has the stronger it is the advantage is these are much easier to remember and type but still hard for cyber attackers to hack ” explains sans twitter sansawareness encrypt data on your usb drives and sim cards encrypt your sim card in case your phone is ever stolen or take it out if you are selling your old cell phone encrypting your data on your removable storage devices can make it more difficult albeit not impossible for criminals to interpret your personal data should your device become lost or stolen usb drives and sim cards are excellent examples of removable storage devices that can simply be plugged into another device enabling the user to access all the data stored on it unless of course it is encrypted “your usb drive could easily be stolen and put into another computer where they can steal all of your files and even install malware or viruses onto your flash drive that will

28,we all hear day in and day out that we amidst a technological revolution but do we know what this really means before we understand how its going to impact us let us first discuss what these terms really mean a technological revolution simply means that we are in a period where better and newer technologies replace the others to get the job done faster and better we are in an era with rapid innovations where machines are being compared to humans fig technological revolution so then what is machine learning machine learning is basically the application of artificial intelligence into electronic systems to enable them to learn and enhance themselves without being programmed by humans it is the evolution and development of computer programs that can access data and then use it to advance themselves whether you know it or not you use machine learning powered applications daily now what is artificial intelligence at its simplest form artificial intelligence is a field which combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problem solving in simple words artificial intelligence is the technology that facilitates these machines to perform human like behaviour just like every other industry machine learning is playing its role in the finance and banking industry too in most cases where a human would perform the same task by performing the same calculations or following the same process can be taught to the machine which can now perform it by itself let us discuss a few examples of the applications that we might have come in our day to day running which are a result of machine learning in this industry portfolio management risk underwriting algorithmic trading fraud detection process automation customer onboarding customer churn decision making process automation portfolio management in earlier days an investor would need to consult a financial advisor to understand his her risk appetite and advise accordingly today using machine learning algorithms there exists the concept of a “robo advisor” that requires any user to give certain inputs about their financial status and goals and calculates their risk tolerance and constructs and idle portfolio allocation for them young users today find this extremely useful rather than physically visiting an advisor and paying a fee for doing so risk underwriting underwriting is one of the core functions for most financial institutions especially banks and insurance companies where they are required to underwrite the risk of the customers before loaning out money or insurance policies these underwriting activities are based on trends and thumb rules industrywide the same has been introduced through machine learning which is able to underwrite risks today on a larger and more accurate scale algorithmic trading machine learning is a mathematical model that tracks market information analyses massive data sources and study market conditions simultaneously to detect patterns which can be used for trading this is humanly impossible to do in a fraction of time algorithmic systems can make millions of trades daily often known as “high frequency trading” it is highly believed that deep learning is playing its role in calibrating real time trading decisions fraud detection with the increase in use and dependency on computers for financial transactions came the data security risk there is an ample amount of valuable data stored online available to create potential risk machine learning thus helped in fraud detection by detecting anomalies in transactions and flagging them for scrutiny based on the risk factors defined by the institutions fraud identification in insurance claims credit card payments identity theft account theft are all areas in fraud detection that machine learning can help in process automation process automation is one of the most common applications of machine learning in finance the technology has helped in replacing manual work automate repetitive tasks to avoid redundancy and as a result increase productivity machine learning has benefitted these organizations to optimize costs improve customer experiences and scale up their services some examples of financial and banking firms using process automation are the use of chatbots automated calls paperwork automation and gamified employee training customer onboarding in this highly competitive industry customer acquisition and the customer onboarding process is highly relevant in building a good customer relationship at any stage during the onboarding a slight inconvenience or delay can act as a barrier machine learning enabled complete automation in this process for these financial and banking institutions today from opening an account filing for any application can be completed within a few minutes with utmost ease with ai customers' behavioral patterns have been studied to improvise and make the whole process efficient and user friendly customer churn with the multitude of offerings and availability of a plethora of options customer stickiness is a big problem faced by financial firms customer churn forecasting is one of the best big data use cases it helps

applications of machine learning in the financial and banking industry yet this is just the tip of the iceberg there is a lot more that is going to change in the future it is now visibly imperative that while ai is beginning to create a wave of transformation across these industries and adapting to these changes s important for one's survival with smart technology applied everywhere all financial firms are bound to turn into fintech's to stay relevant to the “silver tech generation” consisting of millennials and the genzs final thoughts the financial services industry has entered the space of artificial intelligence and machine learning and the pace is not surprising knowing the positive changes it has brought machine learning has the most use cases in finance than any other industry because of the available computer power and new machine learning tools the greatest applications include simplifying customer engagement and accurate sales forecasting it is only making this industry better and more efficient with each new adaptation machine learning algorithms have the capability to deal with a lot more than human capacity along with eliminating human error as even the algorithms are constantly learning and innovating they can serve as a bridge to a completely flawless automated financial system in the future nonetheless the challenges of high cost and lack of

29,it is the year an automaton in a research laboratory says to a scientist “warning error occurred reformatting hard disk now ” the scientist panics automaton says again ” ha ha just kidding “ funny right before some of you say that this joke is not realistic “how can an automaton tell you a joke ” but what if i tell you in “sofia” the robot made a joke on the show good morning britain who thought computers could tell us a joke hard to believe well the idea of giving computers human enjoy thinking has now become a reality thanks to the technological advancement in ai in the last decade before diving deep into how ai can impact the future of work let us begin with the simple question what is ai artificial intelligence provides machines the power to think from data the machine uses the patterns and trends found in data and makes its decision but cannot create thought beyond these patterns and trends fig impact of robots on employments with the rise of ai humans are divided into one question are machines human's friend or foe tech executives and politicians on conference stages campaign rallies and even science fiction hollywood movies like carbon black westworld minority report and ex machina have given their take on this question some believe ai will help us solve problems while others believe that the rise of ai will result in destruction and maybe the end of the world we all know stephen hawking made it no secret of his concern about the rise of superhuman ai that eventually would escape earth to a new planet no this is not a plot of black mirror right now superhumans may not be a reality but ai is “homo deus” the emergence of the new digital god using ai god must also worry as ai might take his job here's some career advice have you thought about being a robot the fear that ai would automate all jobs in the future eventually leaving all humans jobless has been daunting for many workers today statistics show that nearly of workers worry about losing their jobs to robots while another thought that many people believe is that though the rise of ai with result in automating most of the jobs in the future however it also will create millions of new job opportunities ai is already replacing most manual and repetitive tasks for example buying a metro ticket or a movie ticket is now almost a human less interaction each year the number of industrial robot jobs increases by at this rate it is predicted that the million jobs in the manufacturing industry will be replaced by robots due to automation the coronavirus pandemic and recession have boosted the demand for automation the robotic process automation rpa software industry has experienced an increase of in the year coronavirus pandemic has increased interest in technology that reduces human contact as minimal for making workplaces safe our workplaces will look much different in the next five to ten years ai will help humans in simplifying repetitive processes the two most important catalysts for the future of work are the two d's digitization and datafication digitalization is converting data to digital formats computer readable for example text to html analog video to youtube video digitization helps in increasing data exponentially datafication is quantifying human life to data and improving the data driven business model by it is forecasted that the digital transformation space will build in a billion industry one thing is clear no data no future of work what we find is that the future of data and the future of work will go hand in hand the total volume of data in the datasphere that is created captured copied and consumed in the world is predicted to reach zettabytes by to give you a much better picture for understanding if we represent the digital universe as stacks of tablets there would be stacks from earth to the moon it is time to prepare for the data dominated future as industry fourth industrial revolution has begun so let us see how artificial intelligence will affect the following fields human resource nowadays recruiters use ai powered tools for hiring workers using these tools recruiters get insights into a candidate's skills personality and even check whether the candidate is fit for the organization for example the company allyo first identifies high potential candidates through assessment and smart screening and then automatically schedules interviews using ai hr departments at large companies receive hundreds of resumes for a job opening entry level roles focusing on screening and scheduling will be automated ai will automate specific hr jobs not hr roles a deloitte study found that ai has already eliminated low skilled jobs in the uk but million new jobs were also created roles that focus on complex decisions like resolving disputes within a department will continue to be a very human endeavor finance and accounting in a report from accenture named “finance death by digital” predicted that

create insights for example accounting software has already automated bookkeeping tasks that used to be done by humans but that is only opened the door for former bookkeepers to learn skills needed to run and manage the software for employers and clients advisors are another crucial role of the accounting and finance team using the information gained from transactions in books the team creates insights to improve business strategy owing to automation the team spends more time analyzing numbers marketing and sales marketing automation has helped companies strategize the proper utilization of the company's resources managing time and achieving budget targets marketing automation has helped to draw conclusions at a scale no marketer ever would in this process marketers and machines both

30,abstract the way work is being done now is destined to undergo massive transformational changes which will impact humans and their ways of working dramatically with the development of the new machine programs a i is all set to take over the humans in their workplace as no other did now we are not only in competition with other beings but with robots too and robots will overcome us in our fields of work at present we are being surrounded by a i from dusk till dawn from facial recognition present in our mobile application to dating websites applications which uses decision making as their algorithms and learn from the past data as well it is believed that a i has grown over over the last years first let us know what a i is and all the fuss going on about it a i as defined by the internet is simply ‘simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions' this translates to it can work as a human being just at fast speed and with accuracy in my definition i would define a i as the god form of human beings now the question that arises is what does a i entails for the future a i is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers with its introduction to different areas of the workplace it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by a i and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming ai based ventures in different industries thereby giving us our fair share back to us in a survey it was found that some believed that ai will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and tech savvy people believed that inculcating ai technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivals people believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices more modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficient the organizations who are in use of the ai technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using a i and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higher end technology systems as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long run many jobs today require ai and humans working in collaboration which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology beyond just training and developing these machines humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machine it can be said that both the ai advanced technology and human cannot remain in the workforce without each other as the technology will produce accurate and top notch results but it requires someone to make delivery e g in a firm an ai based system produces results based on historical data but there is a need for someone to analyze and communicate and present this data to the respective stakeholders whether inside or outside of the organization various uses of artificial intelligence technology in day to day functions in regards to interactions with humans are chatbots email curation a i powered advertising automated image recognition self sufficient driving voice activation and much more here in this figure a represents ‘artificial intelligence' and b represents ‘humans' artificial intelligence as we know works on algorithms neural networks and deep learning which all are analytical tools that help ai in taking analytical decisions based on the data provided whereas humans on the other hand take higher level decisions based on ‘intuition' sometimes which refers to the gut feeling that generates in humans concerning any situation or challenge ai alone cannot work to handle critical situations on its own as it needs humans for it to reciprocate them and share the information with stakeholders and humans alone cannot anticipate much on the accurate and fast paced analytical solutions to the problems persisting in place of the situation the strength of humans and ai working in synergy can be surprisingly beneficial and advantageous to organizations artificial intelligence and jobs it is believed that machines in the future would be eating up our traditional jobs but the reality seems to be turning otherwise the future trend shows that in future the ai powered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them as and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards gig economies and so in the future we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically some of the jobs today will be replaced by ai which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can be automated in the future years there is an ‘amazon go' store that uses this technology which goes by the name ‘just walk out technology' wherein there is no need for any human induced workforce and all the operations are carried out by ai powered technologies which is indeed a breakthrough technology in today's world rather than eating up our jobs ai in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs back there will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as ‘gen z' they are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand these young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the dynamic changing environment and as most of the activities that are carried out by workers will be automated there will be demand for people working in the back office and maintaining and developing the technology to its best versions artificial intelligence and its constraints ai powered technology has its limitations which makes it a rigid system to hold on to and also which makes it a costly affair at the initial stage it was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged ai model was around million so this super powered ai can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worth one of the major limitations of ai is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased report these machines as do not have neuroscience based technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a single task at the same time it is also believed that there exists no creativity among the computer no matter it is fast paced but they are not intelligent preparing for the future business and organization businesses and organizations need to understand and anticipate the opportunities that the future holds for them and they need to start training their employees based on today's dynamic changing technology while it is still unclear what does the future holds for us but the anticipation of it could benefit us in several ways as we are unclear about what the future looks like we need to think in probable terms how it could turn out to be and then employ specific training programs for the employees of the organization the training the employees are needed to be done on a continuous and lifetime basis which means that education will not be only limited to pg degrees but will be now a lifetime process of learning as the covid changed the scenario of the work patterns around the world we now need to think strategically about the working dynamics of the future and how does it look like compared to the pre covid and post covid scenario employees will be playing a major role in transforming the organizations and work practices in the upcoming future so organizations need to select and recruit the best candidates among the pool and then provide them with best practices of the new machines and make proficient in their area of work policies need to be developed to hire the best people and then retaining the talent in the organization there needs to be a continuous scanning of the environment by the organizations to comprehend any new trends and assess them not all trends will be beneficial for organizations they must be aware of the prospects and plan for the future systematically and consistently conclusion there lies a possibility in future certain years from now we could have machines who will have general human intelligence who would be able to answer deep meaningful questions asking ‘why are the curtains blue ' would be able to clean cars play politics and tell jokes to us and by using deep and machine learning programs their level of intelligence would be beyond mathematical calculations to us that is how good machines will be in the future but to make ourselves competitive with machines we would need to train ourselves for the impending ambiguous future ahead of us humans and machines need to work in synergy to get beneficial and satisfying results for both parties machines are indeed going take away many of our jobs but let me make you sleep

31,abstract artificial intelligence and employment are the burning issues nowadays workers need clarity on as we head into the longer term this article focuses on the various impact of ai on our jobs and explains the benefits of ai in our workplace that right there must have hit a nerve however everything is about to change because this article highlights some of the reasons we should not fear ai what is ai ai is the abbreviation of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is often defined as a set of various technologies which will be brought together to permit machines to act with what appears to be human like levels of intelligence this includes learning rules required to make certain decisions and reasoning to arrive at certain conclusions learning from past experiences and self correction ai is of two types narrow weak ai – ai solution designed and trained for a specific task strong ai – an ai solution whose intelligence matches that of a human brain across multiple differentiated task key moments in the ai journey expectations that machines could match humans in terms of general intelligence by that we mean machines could have the capability to find out reason and react alan turing develops the turing test a test to determine whether a machine is intelligent however it was not for another years or so that any program was deemed to have passed the first time a computer virus defeats a person's world champion during a parlor game john mccarthy invents the new term ‘artificial intelligence' when he held the primary academic conference on the subject of ai arthur samuel‘s machine learning checkers draughts program beat a checkers master reinforcement learning is introduced this is a kind of programming that uses rewards and punishments to coach a machine to interact with its environment a research group led by geoffrey hinton wins the image net competition – this competition requires ai to categorize about million images into any of different categories the level of accuracy was adequate to that of the typical human completing an equivalent task manually eugene goostman's chatbot a bot pretending to be a year old boy supposedly passes the turing test a test which nobody has passed before but controversy arose with this claim as experts claim it only lasted five minutes it had been deemed biased as eugene's mother tongue ukrainian was not equivalent to the judge's english which is a plus as language is one among the few ways we will tell the difference between a person's and machine alibaba's ai model performs better than humans during a reading and comprehension test at stanford university scoring against the scored by humans concerns about ai artificial intelligence ai is here to remain and lots of people are not happy after all it is hard to embrace something that would displace about percent of human jobs within the next years in an interview for cbs's hour kai fu lee a chinese ai expert also mentioned truck drivers chauffeurs waiters and chefs as a number of the professions that will be disrupted but if you were to ask the experts they might unwaveringly confirm that no matter all the noise ai is here to profit us all case in point an executive briefing by the mckinsey global institute revealed that ai and automation are creating opportunities for the economy society and business that said it is time to repress the widespread idea of artificial intelligence taking jobs so let us highlight a number of the useful developments you will expect from this technological phenomenon ai will create jobs while the relationship between artificial intelligence and jobs is a matter of hot debate it is still safe to say that ai will indeed offer new opportunities according to the planet economic forum report robots and ai will create as many ai jobs as they displace this conclusion is entirely viable as it is easy to identify some of the many careers in artificial intelligence for example data scientists who evaluate the decisions made by ai algorithms to eliminate any biases apart from that some other ai occupations include transparency analysts people tasked with classifying the varied sorts of opacity for algorithms smart system interaction modelers experts who develop machine behavior based on employee behavior machine relations managers people that champion the greater use of algorithms that perform well as far because the competition for jobs between humans and robots goes worth noting is that there are jobs that ai cannot replace roles that need leadership empathy and delegation are samples of the various jobs that are safe from automation ai will eliminate bias and a variety of challenges at work automation will stir positive change in the workplace when ai is employed during recruitment or maybe performance management all workers are going to be evaluated in an unbiased fact based manner in turn human resources managers can get to consider other essential strategic undertakings that ensure balance within the workplace ai can help hr departments to use machine learning ml in discovering where issues like bias stem from and assist them to act accordingly faster ml shines in identifying instances of bias in turn this may promote fairness and variety within the work setting ai in the workplace will steer business outcome strategies the impact of ai in business is already felt and this is often expected to continue through to the longer term a few years from now ai oriented architecture is forecasted to require the lead in assisting businesses to hold out operations in additional comprehensive ways thus shifting them from traditional data science and machine learning models it will be necessary to maneuver to business outcomes because ai will play an important role in multiple aspects of the business while there is no way of telling the future of artificial intelligence in business for sure it makes sense for owners to keep up with the evolution to avoid being left behind ai will boost innovation within the workplace in the longer term the workforce of the longer term will lean more towards innovation and creativity businesses have spent higher a part of the previous couple of years studying ai automation and the way they will leverage it to realize results fast with statistics showing that workers spend up to percent of their hours at work performing repetitive tasks every business should consider automating any functions which will be automated automation is not new machines have been replacing human labor in different areas for decades however within the coming years mundane daily tasks will become fully automated already percent of organizations were completely reliant on automation in with repetitive tasks taken care of employees can focus their energies on high value customer oriented tasks and collaboration the designs of workplaces and workflows will also change with the implementation of ai technology more people will begin to figure more closely with machines as companies will strive to become more agile companies that implement ai in their business strategy will experience dramatic improvements in their customer experiences and their employees are going to be more motivated encouraging creativity rather than the performance of repetitive tasks gives workers more fulfillment in their jobs as well with another technology ai will positively impact the world with the web of things and ai working hand in hand identifying trends and solving problems within the business world will become more convenient and also sustainable ai alongside other technologies is predicted to vary the planet by impacting the way businesses run with time we will be ready to combine both human and artificial brains to seek out solutions to major global problems it will even be easier to foresee problems with more accuracy and nip them at the bud with the help of ai but these positive impacts can only be felt if stakeholders are transparent and mindful in their use of the technology for the greater good of everyone else robotics and ai will boost productivity according to a report by pwc percent of companies confirm that the implementation of ai driven solutions in their companies has already improved productivity ai and automation even once they are implemented partially have unlimited potential for any business workers' skills attitude training command chain and workflows protocols are a number of the leading productivity challenges that companies face apart from increasing productivity ai systems will help businesses to chop down on costs improve the standard of their products or services and make better customer profiles as a result companies also will get higher profits which may be shared among stakeholders as dividends or reinvest it back within the business improved productivity also means firms are going to be ready to sell their products at lower prices thereby creating more demand among customers and more job opportunities for workers businesses can therefore use human labor to take up those jobs that have been created by ai and cannot be automated final thoughts on the impact of ai on jobs artificial intelligence is not showing any signs of slowing down soon it will become another necessity of life a bit like the web but for now more and more businesses are beginning to realize how invaluable ai automation and data interpretation are though machines will take some jobs initially the roles created by automation will also keep soaring within the next few years will we have reached the purpose of accelerating human intelligence by artificial means who knows what we all know however is that those that are going to be sought after in ai and employment are individuals who have the relevant skills there is work that not even the machines can do so we should make ourselves as valuable as we can be in our field and we will be irreplaceable

artificial intelligence that was the realm of science fiction for the last several decades ai is probably the most important thing humanities that have ever worked which is more profound than any work with technology as it is important to harness the benefits and while minimizing the downside is focusing on autonomous systems like self driving cars seen as the mother of all ai projects and has made applications like self driving technology viable for the first time three things happen at the same time number one data collection and data processing became easier because of better technologies right um you need data to fuel ai training and that is been one of the big drivers the second thing that has happened is that computer processing has become faster that is like the engine so no matter how much fuel you have if you do not have that engine and processing the data on a timeframe that is reasonable was just not possible and the third thing that is happened is that new algorithms have been developed which has made ai much more powerful so technology has been changing and developing at a pace that is much faster than ever before and we have not been used to this rapid pace of change which means that we have not been used to thinking about how it is going to impact our immediate future the most important factor responsible for the growth of ai is google and its ai what google's done is given all of us the power to get the relevant information we want at our fingertips this has created a shift in how things are bought but it did not happen overnight this started in but the major change only happens to start onwards google's taken away about of sales people's jobs that were primarily order takers and the ones that are remaining are likely to be gone over the next decade in present several ai projects are helping in diagnosing diseases better match up drugs with people depending on what they are sick they can get treated better so it is going to help a whole lot of people get treated and get better healthcare than would have had access to it before if you look at self driving cars they are going to be safer than people driving cars and the value that machine learning is providing is actually happening beneath the surface and it is things like improved search results improved product recommendations for customers improve forecasting for inventory management and literally hundreds of other things including speech recognition or image recognition that the performance levels are phenomenal or drug discovery as these biological systems are very complicated because vaccines for tb and hiv developing that is notably enabled by this rich data advanced in biology and machine learning and recent invention in which is an application we just launched for anybody with visual impairment ass it uses the latest cutting edge computer vision technology to give anyone the ability to see so anyone who has dyslexia can now use ai to be able to read better and with the latest release of windows has this capability called ij's which enable the eye muscle that the gaze can help to type like the two sides of the coin there are negative impacts of ai as well bill gates ellen musk also tech giants in a way their views are pessimistic to say the least they warned against the potential of ai to replace humans in the workplace and ella masks even went as far as to claim that ai is the biggest existential threat to mankind because of the loss of a job when you think about a job or a career choice if a majority of the tasks that comprise that career choice is likely to be these vulnerable tasks then that is a career at risk in the future so what are the tasks that ai will find hard to do anything unpredictable anything that requires skills like creative thinking or empathy or interpersonal skills but it is important to understand tomorrow whether google is there or not artificial intelligence is going to progress you know technology has just nature it is that it is going to evolve as technology and in particular ai can in fact bring more empowerment more inclusiveness and at the same time it is important to be clear eyed about displacement and unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skills so that people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs also the policy decisions that help people as they go through this change people already unhappy because of machine learning artificial intelligence as they think if they are not innovative enough or not creative enough your job will be taking away by a lot of machines ai for business going to affect the future of work specifically there are jobs that are at more risk of being taken over by ai and automation there is very wide dissonance on this there are different reports that have been shared by oxford study that says of us jobs are at risk of automation over the next few years meanwhile the general population and workers think differently a recent study conducted by college actually identifies that of workers believe that most jobs will be automated but not their own this suggests that the general public needs to be educated on which jobs are susceptible to this risk which are not and businesses need to be aware of the forthcoming skills gap of course not all jobs are equal the oxford study that highlights this they examined participants and found the generalist occupations that require creative knowledge or innovation are at least risk the same is true for occupations in education healthcare media and arts jobs on the flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants are at most risk in short there is a simple rule of thumb if your job is in some way predictable or routine the risk of automation is much higher if a job does not require innovation or creativity then the return on investment for companies is higher on machines than real time employees machines are faster cannot be distracted and can work this is actually good for creative marketers because ai and automation can serve to augment their jobs rather than substituting them as impact of emerging technologies on the creative economy they stated that artificial intelligence is changing creative content from beginning to end by ai will be able to write high school essays code in python composed top s chart songs and make creative videos but all of these advancements also come with risks and costs take a look at this report by the global commission on the future of work in the absence of effective transition policies many people will have to accept lower skilled and lower paying jobs high skilled workers are taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers and this is already happening also technological dividends are being unevenly distributed among firms a very limited amount of companies tend to dominate when it comes to big data just think about google and facebook today they alone are responsible for of the referral marketing traffic and receive more than of total global advertising budget so the question is in businesses workers and social institutions go into the same direction if companies and public policy leaders can understand the evolving landscape they can help the workforce anticipate the upcoming challenges technology and the demographic changes are leading to a smaller workforce compared to the previous generation and a workforce that has to pursue many careers during their time of work we need to provide workers with an environment where they can continuously upskill and grow governments will have to re evaluate the educational system we will have to continuously learn and grow and companies will have to redesign their structure and their culture around technology just like during the industrial revolution we are heading into a new age and the great transformation that we are about to see by it is estimated that to percent of the labor force will be displaced within to years however this is also an opportunity for people to get ahead for which different ways have to be find to attract and retain highly skilled workers and allow them the time to up skill themselves even during work hours and it is a good way to develop a learning community to benefit from each other and also to use technology to supplement goal tracking and efforts instead of as a distraction in short what we are doing is to bridge the dissonance and it is imperative to build a map of how ai and automation will affect industry and company if this is an economic imperative how do people feel about committing itself to a lifelong approach to knowledge as these risks are important but it is important to do things like from being upfront to have ethical charters like ai safety and to be very transparent and open and how we perceive progress there and figure out global frameworks by which we can engage just like paris agreement and climate change by using such forums bring people together as they engage on the hard questions and it will emerge answers and on the question of whether ai is a threat or not artificial intelligence is not a threat because there is a rare case where people need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because i think by the time we are reactive in ai regulation it is too late right now we have machine learning algorithms that can solve an incredibly complex problem beyond any human intelligence as they are mere machines that can be given enormous data set and they come up with brilliant correlations and insights but they are not going threaten the human population anytime soon because fish intelligent is not terrible but human being a smart enough to learn that skills at least to

intended message can differ from genre to genre the target for each medium could be different advertised content could be in print radio tv or digital formats we will look at how the advertising market has changed over the last ten decade advertising is a form of communication that aims to persuade a target audience typical advertising messages endorse programs goods concepts people and companies first conventional types of advertising were used to carry out advertising let us take a look at the traditional forms of advertising advertising can include in flight advertising street furniture passenger displays billboards skywriting posters wall paintings banners taxi cabs passenger screens television and newspaper advertisements press advertising other types of advertising include press advertisements in magazines and newspapers advertising in the classified section of a newspaper is an example of press advertising a billboard or digital screen placed on a moving vehicle is often referred to as a mobile billboard guerrilla advertising when a brand or product is used in a large entertainment venue it is known as convert ads or guerrilla advertising when a soft drink a watch or a pair of sneakers is seen or mentioned in a common film this is an example of this in store advertising ad in supermarket videos aisles and on the inside of shopping carts is referred to as in store advertising consumers are influenced by celebrity advertisements because of the power of wealth fame and popularity however if a celebrity falls out of favor the use of that celebrity may be detrimental to a company non commercial ads religious organizations political parties political candidates and special interest groups are examples of noncommercial ads these were the conventional forms of advertisement but as the internet and technology progressed the advertising industry began to play a role in helping brands establish a digital presence and advertising their products in a new way the advertising industry is a multibillion dollar global company that connects producers with customers according to the research firm emarkerter global media advertising spending totaled nearly billion in with digital advertising accounting for nearly of that amount for more than a decade consumers' perspectives have been shifted in favor of commercials advertisements

36,before we get into the whole discussion let us first discuss the basic working of data analysis data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning transforming and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision making using data analysis we can extract useful information from the given data and then take corresponding decisions based upon the analyzed data during the pandemic known as covid many businesses failed to grow whereas many touched the sky for example the transportation of raw materials was drastically low because the nationwide lockdown was imposed low production due to a smaller number of workers storage facilities were shut down and many more for such reasons on the other hand new business startups got a chance to compete in the market by getting early responses from the companies they wanted to tie up with or from the head of the companies that they wanted investments from the data analysis can help businesses in many ways such as using different statistical models that are used in data analysis the businesses can predict the approximate requirement for the product in the near future and hence they can produce it accordingly it makes it easier to track the requirement and produce the product accordingly because of the lockdown people had to start working from home which became a huge advantage for the businesses as they would get quicker responses from their tie ups using data analysis businesses can create several models and structures to measure the growth of the company and also to make devised plans to increase the revenues and decrease the losses data analysis provides different analytical techniques such as text analysis statistical analysis diagnostic analysis predictive analysis prescriptive analysis using these techniques businesses can analyze everything and predict almost anything these techniques tools and models can help businesses tackle this horrendous situation that is covid blackcoffer insights shaili sharma st xavier s college,13,discussion discuss basic working data analysis data analysis defined process cleaning transforming modeling data discover information business decision making data analysis extract information data decisions based analyzed data pandemic covid businesses failed grow touched sky transportation raw materials drastically low nationwide lockdown imposed low production due smaller number workers storage facilities shut reasons hand business startups chance compete market early responses companies wanted tie head companies wanted investments data analysis businesses ways statistical models data analysis businesses predict approximate requirement product future produce makes easier track requirement produce product lockdown people start working home huge advantage businesses quicker responses tie ups data analysis businesses create models structures measure growth company make devised plans increase revenues decrease losses data analysis analytical techniques text analysis statistical analysis diagnostic analysis predictive analysis prescriptive analysis techniques businesses analyze predict techniques tools models businesses tackle horrendous situation covid blackcoffer insights shaili sharma st xavier college,2,4,-0.33333327777778704,150,0.03999999973333333,11.538461538461538,11.538461538461538,127,84.66666666666667,38.48205128205129,2.5933333333333333,7.153333333333333,3
37,dreams are powerful right be it for escaping reality envisioning the future or for experiencing adventures like spacewalk or time travel we all love dreaming so if i ask you what do your eighties look like what do you imagine well once i dreamt of my dotage and i was surprised by the world i imagined living in every morning i would wake up listening to sweet chirps beside a sparkling brook that ran through the lush green mountains in that world older people like me would not suffer from any breathing problems frequent traffic jams congested buildings and industries emitting excessive smoke were forlorn memories history books would include chapters on the ‘climate action strike' biodiversity restoration and water conservation campaign in those aging times of mine i would sit for hours by the riverside observing the blooming aquatic life then the swiftly jumping fishes would splash water onto my face suddenly shattering this wonderful world that i was in love with coming back to the present out of this imaginary world now i constantly question myself “will this just remain a dream ” well i believe coronavirus lockdown is a positive kick start to transform my pleasant dream into the ultimate reality the lockdown has shown how to live green but surely it has its own implications due to the covid many countries imposed lockdowns to curb the virus the world has faced difficult times due to rising issues in the economic sector public health infrastructure and instability in global cooperation these serious issues undoubtedly have to be addressed with utmost priority and without overshadowing the existing global problems notwithstanding the harm to the various sectors the environment we live in has also been quite closely impacted by the covid pandemic and in an unprecedented manner it is interesting to explore more about how the covid lockdown has impacted biodiversity around the globe during the lockdown for the very first time humans were caged in their homes and animals no more had fear of someone heckling them even though some animals celebrated their freedom many suffered due to the lack of attention have you wondered what happened to those already endangered species who were suddenly left uncared for unfortunately because of the home confinement social isolation the staff at such places was also reduced and this has increased illegal activities reports from kenya cambodia and the philippines have confirmed an uptick in poaching illegal logging and wildlife trafficking data collection and studies regarding animal livelihood were halted making regular health monitoring of different species nearly impossible moreover the pandemic triggered a nasty economic recession leading to a reduction in funding for wildlife preservation considering the severity of the unprecedented threats to biodiversity the conservation efforts need to be funded at higher amounts than the level they were at before the pandemic on nd may we celebrated the international day of biological diversity with the theme – “our solutions are in nature” have you ever wondered why we need a special day to recognize the importance of biodiversity it is because we need to stop the deliberate negligence towards the flora and fauna and realize that living happily is also their fundamental right though biodiversity conservation was overlooked during the lockdown let us see some encouraging examples where nature itself tried to heal the wounds that we have caused in the midst of this pandemic the coronavirus lockdown has been incredibly beneficial for marine life in many parts around the globe reduced levels of pollution and human activities have allowed underwater ecosystems to rejuvenate themselves giving us some miraculously soothing experiences like live dolphinariums in the canals of venice only a few weeks of lockdown had led to the improved quality of water in river ganga the returning of endangered species of turtles to the beaches in thailand and the recovery of horseshoe crabs along the shores of new jersey are some other examples though this deadly pandemic should not be considered an acceptable way to rejuvenate the endangered ecosystems it surely has shown how positively the wild creatures respond when humans take a step back this pandemic is proof that “our solutions are in nature and this is our only option” it surely gives us hope that like the covid curve we can also “bend the curve of biodiversity loss” and encourages us to develop sustainable and earth friendly solutions to build back a greener earth it has taught us that building back better is possible more quickly than we had expected and this is the right time we start focusing on ‘green jobs' jobs that genuinely contribute to a sustainable world like humans nature too has emotions but is a bit more expressive in its unique ways colorful rainbows and mild breezes passing through tall trees might be its way of sharing happiness it might get angry at our destructive activities causing volcanic eruptions huge bush fires etc in frustration we sometimes plan a vacation to relieve the stress and mother earth also desires the same i wonder if mother earth has just put down this pandemic as leave for vacation to heal herself if it is so then it would be better next time we willingly give her a weeklong yearly vacation by reducing human activities and recreating the lockdown scenario although this will affect economic growth this will help to maintain harmony between human beings and biodiversity to avoid human sufferings as a consequence it is high time now that we take collective action and build a shared future for all creatures in the ecosystem in a greener way and with more nature based solutions let us all pledge to flatten the curve of deforestation habitat destruction and climate disruption to prevent our mother earth from reaching ‘the point of no return' and ‘dire catastrophe' ideas like weeklong yearly lockdown can be cherished for developing sustainable solutions to ‘shift from the grey to green economy' with collective efforts we can definitely bounce back greener from this pandemic when nature itself through this lockdown has shown a trailer of green living so why not create a beautiful movie out of it blackcoffer insights dhanashree revagade and

38,the covid pandemics forced factories to shut down flights getting canceled and a massive decrease in the global economy with a significant decrease in green house gases ghg in many developed and developing countries the sars cov came into the spotlight in december and has impacted most of the countries till then nearly million peoples were infected worldwide and resulting in deaths of around million according to world health organisation who most of the countries dealt with the new virus by imposing strict lockdowns and social distancing to control the spread of the virus these policies caused adverse effects worldwide one of the most important impacts of the covid pandemic is on the environment there have been few positive impacts on the environment due to lockdown like air pollution has decreased dramatically as people were asked to stay in their houses due to the lockdowns there has also been a sharp decline in environmental noise environmental noise can be well defined as the unwanted or harmful outdoor sounds caused by human activities like noise emitted by road traffics air traffics rail traffics and industrial activities it is one of the most important challenges in the modern era as noise pollution can cause adverse effects on humans as well as harm many animals too the imposition of lockdown and quarantine by various nation's governments has caused people to remain back at their homes because of this the movement of people from one place to a different place has reduced significantly and the use of personal and public transport has also decreased due to all these changes the environmental noise generated in most of the cities has dropped substantially water pollution at beaches have reduced significantly and many animals were spotted back in the cities but the covid virus has also generated many negative and indirect effect on the environment to begin with some of the developed countries have halted their sustainability program during the pandemic in the united states and in many other european nation states waste recycling plants have been suspended in many municipalities and cities due to the concern of the virus getting spread at the recycling centers this has resulted in an increase in the use of single use plastic bags instead of the re usable bags by many leading restaurants firms and corporations for instance starbucks a leading coffee company during the month of march has announced a short lived ban on the utilization of recyclable and reusable cups furthermore with most of the people staying indoors because of the lockdown majority of the department stores shops restaurants and food outlets are closed making an online purchase and food delivery are quite high this has created more consumption and demand for fossil fuels due to the transportation and mobility of these goods to each individual there has been an enormous upsurge of medical waste because most of the products employed by healthcare professionals are usually single use items that can be used only once before they are disposed of some of these wastes include used masks personal protection kits and gloves for instance nearly tons of medical waste were generated during the peak of the pandemic breakout in wuhan china this is tones more than the average waste generated before the outbreak in wuhan these organic and inorganic wastes generated due to the policies crafted by the government takes a heavy toll on the environment and can cause environmental issues like water pollution air pollution soil erosion and can harm the local flora and fauna the demand for masks during the pandemic has become skyrocketing but the materials required for the production of these masks are highly dangerous for the environment as they are generally composed of non woven fabrics polyester polystyrene polyethylene and polycarbonate are some common materials used for the surgical mask with density lying between grams to grams sq meter these materials are mostly resistant to liquids and are plastic based products with a really high afterlife after being discarded if not treated properly without discarding they end up filling the landfills and the oceans making it dangerous to aquatic lifeforms for example recently the environment in hong kong has started degrading drastically during the pandemic with the accumulation of these clinical wastes with recycling plants on hold piles of small mountains of wastes and their depositions at open areas are formed due to the increasing number of unrecycled wastes generated every day this makes the surrounding more vulnerable and also creating a high risk of air pollutions as the dumped open wastes decays into methane ch a greenhouse gas hence increasing the risk of global warming too not only the surroundings are getting affected by these careless methods but the local people are also getting affected if the excess methane gets accumulated in the earth's atmosphere due to piles of unrecycled wastes this could result in increases in earth's average temperature and can be harmful to future generations many protected and endangered flora and fauna are facing much greater risks due to the imposition of the lockdown many countries under lockdown have made people stay inside their homes the employees ngos and volunteers working in these protected areas like national parks marine conservation zones and wildlife sanctuaries are made to stay at home making these protected and endangered flora and fauna unattended this has also led to an increase in many illegal activities like wildlife hunting illegal deforestation and fishing activities due to the absence of these people the prohibition of eco tourism has also led to a significant financial drop in the economy of these protected areas some nations like china have asked the local authorities and native government bodies to increase the amount of disinfection routine mainly to increase the dosage of chlorine in the wastewater treatment plant to prevent the spread of the covid virus however according to who no solid evidence has been found on the survival of the virus on the lifespan of the virus in wastewater as well as in drinking water despite the fact that excessive amounts of chlorine in water can cause harmful problems and issues associated with people's health like bladder cancer and it also damages its cells the covid is a reminder that the health of the planet is also linked to the health of humans evidence proves that the virus is zoonotic meaning it can be transmitted between people and animals they are accountable for seventy five percent of all emerging infectious diseases in the world with the virus infecting millions of people every day across the globe various governments and agencies' top priority is to regulate the spread of the virus by shifting the spotlight on the management and treatment of wastes especially the clinical and medical waste likewise at the same time we as responsible individuals need to step up and follow the necessary guideline and precautions for the disposal of the waste and medical gears in spite of various data showing that the pollutions have reduced significantly during the pandemic history has witnessed a rise in pollution during any “post financial crisis” a similar case was observed during the financial crash – although there was a temporary decrease in emissions of was observed but as the economy recovered in emissions were at an all time high after all only through sheer mutual empathy and goodwill that the world will emerge stronger after this global pandemic to prevent future outbreaks we must address regularly the threats to the ecosystems and wildlife including habitat loss illegal trade pollution and climate change as human life depends on earth's life if you live near a spacious outdoor area like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it is the only safe surface less space to take a walk in then you begin to realize the beauty of nature the point is not to remain indoors but to avoid being in close contact with others when you do leave your home whether it is for a walk

39,even though covid has not yet halted and we are facing the nth wave of the coronavirus outbreak across several countries most notably the us india and brazil it is a fact that data analytics and ai are the big guns of our artillery in this fight against the covid pandemic it has helped us in several stages of this outbreak like the detection of its first outbreak vaccine development and manufacturing contact tracing and future hotspot detection some of these interesting applications are discussed in this article a lesser known fact is that the covid outbreak was first detected in toronto canada nearly miles away from the first outbreak nine days before the who issued its warning it was with the help of big data analytics and ai more specifically deep learnings dl a subset of machine learning application in natural language processing nlp to analyze text inputs that traced the surge of pneumonia cases in the wuhan province of china the specialty of dl algorithms is that they mimic the brain cells called neurons and can identify patterns in big data this dl backed software is used as inputs reports from public health organizations global airline ticketing data etc these were used to flag unusual surges and potential spreads of infectious diseases the next application of big data analytics and ai was in the research and development of drugs to halt covid ai was used to analyze the protein structure of the virus findings that were significant in the progress of vaccine development in preliminary studies it was found that it does not mutate as fast as other viruses such as hiv which means that a prophylactic vaccine is a better way to proceed rather than a therapy but there is also some evidence supporting the fact that when we find any kind of cure for it there is a chance of the virus mutating which is what happened and major mutations have been found in the uk brazil and south africa ai also assisted scientists in rapidly shortlisting a set of already available vaccines that could be effective against the coronavirus another interesting application of ai can be found in the selection of the right candidates i e most likely to test positive for testing coronavirus in case of insufficient testing resources this method was first exercised on greek borders and was called project eva whenever a traveler wanted to come into greece he had to fill out a form known as passenger locator form plf at least hours prior to arrival containing information on their origin country demographics point and date of entry and the intended destination eva then allocated testing resources according to the size of the set of passengers to be tested after the test results if found positive they are put in quarantine the results were sent back to the program for real time learning the question remains how eva made allocations it was found that statistically only the origin country and the city were significant factors for screening ultimately from a variety of countries and city pairs eva had to predict how many testing resources were to be allocated at each entry point and to particular passengers from a location is technically called the multi armed bandit mab problem and the chosen method to solve this problem was an ai algorithm called optimistic gittins index this algorithm identified on average x as many asymptomatic infected travelers as random surveillance testing and up to x as many during peak travel after the test results if found positive they are put in quarantine following the collection of significant data through the aforementioned process after a certain period policies were made categorizing them separately and imposing restrictions on travelers from the specific location this eva as presented above was in operation from august th to november st processing around plfs each day and testing on an average of households entering the country every day above mentioned applications just show the tip of the iceberg and there is more to get into some of the other developments to watch for include the use of image recognition to identify covid based on x ray images the use of deep learning to predict the d

40,“data is the new oil” has become the most important trendline of the st century the reason for this is the advancements in the fields related to data analysis the field of ai machine learning statistics and data mining all deal with data and are developing at such a staggering pace that these fields have become the most popular buzzwords these days buzzwords are originated through technical terms but often the underlying essence is ignored through fashionable use and mainly used to impress this is the main reason for the misconception amongst people ai ml stats data mining and many other fields related to the analysis of data are most often mistook for one and the same thing thus all these words are often used interchangeably to convey one and the same thing but this is not true at all the only similarity between these disciplines is that all of these disciplines are related to the analysis of the data and converting this data into “information” in academics while learning ai machine learning statistics and data mining the academic approach only wander in the technical definitions and concepts but the underlying essence and the aim of the discipline remain unexplored same is the case with most of the articles out there which try to explain the difference thus becoming the primary cause of confusion between learners hence this article explains the difference by explaining the philosophy and the aims of each of the disciplines rather than wandering in the technical definitions then what is the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data mining the essential difference between these disciplines lies in their “aims” and the approach taken to achieve those aims the aims of each of these fields are explained in detail in the following sections artificial intelligence the aim of artificial intelligence is to understand intelligent entities then to satisfy this aim we must first understand what is intelligence and what makes an agent intelligent agent the answer to all these questions can be found by studying intelligent agents and the best example of an intelligent agent can be found by just standing in front of a mirror yes humans are the best examples of intelligent entities thus in the s researchers began exploring the thought process the reasoning process of humans as human beings were considered as an ideal intelligent agent mimicking human behavior became the aim of ai in the initial years of the research after setting this goal studies and experiments began and the most famous experiment conducted in the initial years to achieve this aim was the turing test turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human level performance in all cognitive tasks sufficient to fool an interrogator but this test received criticism as only mimicking human behavior is not exactly intelligence because intelligence should be related to the working of the human brain as without the human brain intelligence has no meaning thus mimicking human thought processes and reasoning became the transformed aim the field of psychology and philosophy also resonate with this aim that is to understand the human thought process the difference is that ai not only tries to understand the thought process but to mimic it build it the collaboration of these fields resulted in models such as neural networks which try to mimic the function of neurons present in the human brain so basically this initial aim was human centered and humans were considered as the ideal intelligent agent concurrently the field of computer science was developing at a greater pace with the advances in computer science the experiments and theories could be easily tested and validated as programs were being applied to solve real life problems it was found that computers performed better than humans at some tasks that are really complex for humans one of the best examples of this could be the chess playing program an ai program defeated the world's best chess player garry kasparov this incident indicated that human intelligence is not the ultimate intelligence or else a human would have been able to defeat the ai program this leads to a question is human intelligence the ideal intelligence as computers became more advanced they proved to be better than humans at certain complex tasks that is why the new definition of intelligence was being related to the ability to solve cognitive tasks or problems so rather than considering the nature of agents researchers began to study the nature of intelligence itself then the question comes how to test or validate intelligence the best way to test intelligence is to solve cognitive problems an agent can be said intelligent only if it can solve a complex problem the problem solving approach can be easily tested and validated on computers thus some researchers began studying the ideal intelligence and the selected agent to validate the experiments was the computer so a computer and problem solving approach were adopted so the human centered approach and computer problem solving approach are the two main aims of ai both of these fields have contributed to the field by giving valuable insights both the aims are important and both of these collaboratively form the main aim of ai machine learning in the problem solving approach there is a big challenge that ai has to overcome in order to achieve its aim consider the example of solving a math problem there are two cases by which intelligence can be tested in this problem solving approach let us say two math problems are given for you to solve the first problem is familiar to you and the second problem is not consider the first problem the first problem is familiar to you that means you know how to solve such kind of problems as you have already solved some similar problems in the past so there comes a question how our mind is able to solve that problem the answer is that you have solved similar problems in the past thus you have learned from the past data how to solve such problems thus even if you have not seen that problem in the past you will still be able to solve similar problems this is one form of intelligence consider another case where you are given a second problem where you have not solved such kind of problems in the past then to solve this problem you will try to consciously gather and manipulate the given information so that you reach a certain conclusion this kind of approach does not necessarily rely on the past data but completely on the reasoning process this is the second kind of intelligence for ai to build intelligent agents both of these kinds of intelligence must be developed in the agent but the reality is that ai has reached the point where it is able to build agents which can only learn from past data and find some useful information ai today has not reached a point where it can build agents who can think on their own that is the second type of intelligence so the way ai is able to implement the first type of intelligence is through machine learning so the domain of ai which focuses solely on implementing the first kind of intelligence is in fact machine learning that is the reason why ml is called the subset of ai so this is the main difference between ai and ml technically speaking “it is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from past data and find some meaningful conclusions patterns without being explicitly programmed” this statement needs some elaboration the essence of ml is related to the process of “generalization” and learning from past data generalization is an abstraction by which common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims consider how we humans recognize daily life objects if we see an animal then we can easily recognize if it is a “dog” or a “cat” it is a very trivial task for us but have you ever wondered how our mind is able to do it the answer is generalization if you were given a picture of a dog you can easily recognize that it is a picture of a dog because our minds have abstracted the description of a dog and formulated it into a “concept” of what a dog is and these concepts became better and better as we learned from the past experiences of a dog so the way we think is dependent on the fact that things are represented as generalized concepts in our minds with generalization only can come real “information” so we try to give computers the ability to generalize the “raw data” and convert it into “information” which can be patterns and trends in the data on their own statistics this is the discipline that concerns the collection organization analysis interpretation and presentation of data statistics tries to deal with data with the only aim that is to explain it so it is the study of explaining the data itself statistics has two main domains which are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics descriptive statistics deals with the explanation or description of data thus the name “descriptive” statistics it tries to explain as much information as possible easily about the whole large data which would be a very complex task otherwise inferential statistics try to make accurate inferences from the available small data we use inference in many tasks in our daily lives consider a simple case of cooking a soup after completing the recipe you will taste a small sample that is a spoonful of the soup to check if the soup tastes good or bad depending upon the result of the sample you make an inference about the whole soup that if the soup as a whole good or bad similarly in statistics there are cases where you have to apply inference to have meaningful information for example consider a case where you cannot gather the whole data because it is very time consuming and costly in these cases applying inference based on the available sample introduces uncertainty that is where inferential statistics come for help so the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty is what statistics deals with so however and whatever the data statistics tries to explain that data this aim does not resonate with that of ai and ml but statistics help these fields to correctly interpret the data data mining “data” is not useful at all in its raw form consider examples of sensors used in industrial applications these sensors might be used in a manufacturing plant to sense different properties like temperature pressure etc the raw data generated by these sensors are not useful until and unless it is converted to a suitable form then processed analyzed to gather valuable insights which can be used to solve a problem due to its unique aim of capturing the essence of very large datasets to gather insights data mining is also referred to as “knowledge discovery” that is why carly fiorina former ceo of hewlett packard once said “the goal is to turn data into information and information into insight” this statement completely explains the aim of data mining so the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data mining lies in their aims but the approaches taken in all of these fields help in one way or the other in fulfilling the aims of the other fields this is the beauty of these fields blackcoffer

43,from what i have learned on the mobile apps development market recently it is becoming harder for an android or ios developer to find a suitable and well paying job in the market some major reasons include the increasing supply of mobile engineers people generally stop downloading apps and many more in this article i will go through a more detailed explanation of the recent trend mentioned above and my two cents on what mobile engineers could do to prepare themself for the upcoming challenge and the future of mobile apps coding bootcamps increase the supply side for mobile apps developers although the demand for mobile developers has not fallen sharply compared with previous years the growth rate has slowed on the other hand owing to a great number of coding boot camps that target to bring up mobile and frontend engineers a great number of developers are flooding into the developer job market the supply side for mobile engineers has increased rapidly in recent years raising the standards for qualified mobile engineers the days of a mobile engineer easily getting over job offers are over recode ran an article in mid that begins “the mobile app boom kicked off in july when apple introduced the app store now it is over ” according to data gathered and analyzed by the cakeresume team javascript and python are now the most in demand programming languages for companies who post product development jobs on cakeresume both together taking up almost half of the job opportunities while mobile engineers taking up merely of the job opportunities learn more about tech salaries in taiwan tech salaries in taiwan overview people stop downloading mobile apps while app usage continues to grow and revenue also ascends the majority of consumers actually download zero apps per month let us face the truth born and raised up in the era of the information explosion individuals do not have the leisure to check on what is new on the app store every day when it comes to choosing an app to download many people feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available take the productivity category of the app store as an example there are over thousands of apps in this category and new apps popping up almost every week it is almost impossible for users to dig through and learn all the apps they just choose what is on top then click install and not to mention that if you could build an awesome productivity app google and apple could do it times better and faster than you in the end there is not as much need for individual apps to accomplish similar convenience factors what you could do to prepare for the future changes for mobile apps although the bull run for mobile development has ended there are still over billion smartphone users billion mobile apps downloaded and time spent per day on mobile devices has increased rapidly in recent years moreover apps offer a user experience that even ‘responsive websites' are unable to provide in order to stay on top of the game you will have to differentiate yourself from the pack — other mobile engineers if you are a mobile engineer who only knows how to code and tweak your app's ui you are not that different from others after all below i listed a few ways that you could implement so that you could stay competitive in the job market choose newer technologies when you have the chance if you are an android developer you could start choosing a job involving kotlin or flutter which are backed by google if you are an ios developer try to look for a job to get involved with using swift although older mobile coding languages such as java and objective c still have their upsides the main reason why kotlin and swift are created at first is to address the older languages issue it means that kotlin and swift provide many safety mechanisms available out of the box while being more concise and expressive than java and objective c at the same time kotlin vs java which one you should choose for your next android app a detailed comparison of java and kotlin to help you decide which language will work best for your next mobile… objective c vs swift in the article covers a brief comparison between objective c and swift in with abi stability build up your domain knowledge and industry skills this point is especially crucial each industry has its specific skills to learn and refine for example if you are building a stock foreign exchange future or options market app you will have to understand the websocket protocol which lets you transfer as much data as you like without incurring the

48,in this era everyone is busy in his life no one spares time for someone so robots tackle life loneliness we have no time to stand and stare this causes loneliness loneliness is due to fast moving life and hurry and worry in the st century everyone is spending most of their time earning money they are day by day transforming into money earning machines due to his perception we are losing our relations as we cannot give enough time to our families they are busy earning their livelihood they never get satisfies and always want more everyone is in a race of earning and then sends his children far away from himself to make them well settled in order to maintain their status but one faces the consequences of this kind of lifestyle in his old age people usually do not spend time with their children when their children are in their childhood but they yearn for the company of their children in their old age they feel lonely but have none to talk with they are still attached to people places belongings and memorable events from the past although they understand that life cannot continue the same way as earlier and this may easily result in feelings of loneliness and social isolation as they become older they need to be attended to in order to meet their daily needs robots can indeed serve the purpose but they can aid only mechanical care they are just emotionless feeling fewer entities robots are not creative they can work only according to a pre programmed system and till now no such software has been created that can transfer human feelings into robots this is the major loophole of using robots to tackle late life loneliness they can undoubtedly serve their masters but their masters cannot share their feelings with them as they are incapable to understand or react to them they cannot change their activity according to the occasion they can provide anything except emotional satisfaction and without emotional gratification loneliness cannot be tackled a master can be attached to his robot but that attachment is only due to their service they cannot share their thoughts with them in this era we are rendered lonely and in late life feel the need for a companion with whom we can talk we feel a need for someone who can listen to us react and advise us to tackle our day to day life problems but we cannot find one we have undoubtedly achieved great progress in terms of technology but we can never fill the void in the heart of a person struggling with his late life loneliness with our advancements we are in a kind of mental trance in which we experience fame progress wealth etc but when we gain our consciousness we find ourselves lonely in this world relations in life are actual wealth in a person's life we can never enjoy such a bond with a robot it will follow our commands take our appropriate care but cannot react to our emotions it cannot console us when a man lives in loneliness for a long time it eats up his conscience and transforms him into a machine robots can never become our friends crack jokes weep our tears or establish an emotional connection with us they cannot understand our feelings many people go into depression depression or the occurrence of depressive symptoms is a prominent condition amongst older people with a significant impact on their well being and quality of life they remain sick and loneliness directly impacts longevity lonely people often think that they are no longer needed in this world and thus they want to die it impacts their mental psychological social and physical health robots prove to be useless in these matters they can provide motivation only if they have the software to do so but cannot themselves react to such a situation they do not know about anger happiness or sadness they do not themselves bring food when their master is hungry until commanded to do so they cannot even offer a glass of water themselves a man living without relations and without fellow feeling no longer remains a human being he becomes none less than a machine as due to his loneliness he becomes mentally ill and goes into a condition like trauma where he no longer enjoys nature's blessings becomes happy or sad as he loses the ability to react and hence cannot act it is a dangerous situation we face a plethora of challenges in assisted living facilities such as not being addressed to emotional needs being neglected and forcing a withdrawal from social activities relations in life interaction with fellow beings sharing of joy and happiness and fellow feeling make a man

healthcare and diagnostic industry it has helped in the development of this industry and enhances life for millions of people the condition of india in terms of healthcare has been quite grim patients who need attention are neglected and are unable to avail proper treatment or diagnosis however with the coming up of digitization there has been hoped for this industry also according to dr keshab panda ceo md l t technology services there are three trends emerging in the healthcare and diagnostics ecosystem as a result of digitization value based healthcare this is a model of healthcare where doctors and hospitals are paid based on patient health outcomes the coming up of digital tools in this segment of healthcare can be considered as the starting tool dr panda further says that the implementation of advanced digital technologies in patient care domains like mobile health apps telehealth wearables and remote monitoring can help in enhancing accessibility boost efficiency and augment the effectiveness of treatment and preventive care new product development the healthcare industry over the past few decades has changed drastically with the coming of emerging technologies new surgical procedures and medical devices have been made available connectivity while talking about connectivity in healthcare dr panda said that with digitization taking over the industry it is only a matter of time when with the help of the internet and smartphones digital healthcare will be everywhere the internet for once has helped doctors connect to their patients and also with one another this has helped in enhancing the doctor patient engagement by increasing their interaction time big data aggregates information about a business through formats such as social media ecommerce online transactions and financial transactions and identifies patterns and trends for future use for the healthcare industry big data can provide several important benefits including lower rate of medication errors – through patient record analysis the software can flag any inconsistencies between a patient's health and drug prescriptions alerting health professionals and patients when there is a potential risk of a medication error facilitating preventive care – a high volume of people stepping into emergency rooms are recurring patients also called “frequent flyers ” they can account for up to of visits big data analysis could identify these people and create preventive plans to keep them from returning more accurate staffing – big data's predictive analysis could help hospitals and clinics estimate future admission rates which helps these facilities allocate the proper staff to deal with patients this saves money and reduces emergency room wait times when a facility is understaffed challenges for future digitalization of healthcare cybersecurity although ransomware data breaches and other cybersecurity concerns are nothing new to the healthcare industry the covid pandemic revealed just how vulnerable sensitive patient health information really is the recent growth of digital health initiatives like telehealth doctor visits — is a major contributor to the severe increase in breached patient records as more healthcare functions continue to move online over the next year it is extremely important to ensure these processes are protected from outside threats invoicing and payment processing medical practices are citing patient collections as their top revenue cycle management struggle as patients are becoming responsible for a larger portion of their medical bills in order to help encourage patients to submit payments in a timely manner providers must adhere to patient payment preferences to meet patient expectations and improve the user experience ensure billing statements are patient friendly you should offer paperless statements and a variety of payment options e g credit card etc via an online patient portal and utilize the latest payment technologies such as mobile and text to pay new features like text or email reminders help effectively communicate with patients and encourage them to pay their financial obligations patient experience the medical insurance landscape has experienced some significant changes in recent years as more patients are responsible for a larger portion of their healthcare bill they naturally demand better services from their providers healthcare organizations will face tougher competition in attracting and retaining patients who demand an experience that matches the level of customer service they expect from other consumer brands they demand a streamlined patient experience so they can “self service” to resolve most questions issues or concerns e g downloading an immunization record

51,one thought always comes to my mind… what if we lived without that dander hanging over our heads and you all know what is that danger is for more than years the world has faced the very real threat of nuclear war nuclear war is a real and growing threat the united states and russia have left critical agreements and treaties while actively planning to add new types of weapons to their arsenals meanwhile us nuclear policy remains rooted in the cold war increasing the risk that nuclear weapons could be used again it does not have to be this way with the right policy changes and a commitment to diplomacy the united states can be a leader in reducing the nuclear threat and we can also help them but the question arises is what are the activities are being done for the prevention of nuclear holocaust and they are pressuring congress to support change holding the white house accountable through independent research and analysis increasing public demand for changing nuclear weapon policies now the question is what can we do to prevent a nuclear holocaust tell government do not fund a nuclear arms race call for investment in public health and public security not nuclear weapons tell government the united states should never start a nuclear war urge presidential candidates to make preventing nuclear war a priority activist resources nuclear weapons are extremely strong to show the power of a nation but no one knows the drawback of this attack between the two countries for example hiroshima and nagasaki the realistic bomb blast explained the blood of each people the crux of my presentation is that the circumstances surrounding nuclear war call for a new level of commitment by the scientific community to reduce the risk of nuclear war to generate new options for decreasing the risk we need analytical work by people who know the weaponry and its military uses but that is far from enough to do the job we also need scholars who know the superpowers in depth people who know other nuclear powers people who know third world flashpoints people who know international relations very broadly people who know a lot about policy formation and implementation especially in the superpowers people who understand human behavior under stress especially leadership under stress people who understand negotiation and conflict resolution people and much more in other words the relevant knowledge and skills cut right across all the physical biological behavioral social international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war world health british medical association and the american medical association others have contributed as well the central point is that a kind of awakening has occurred in the medical community to the responsibility of addressing the immense nature of the threat to public health at last i want to conclude that “ in a nuclear war except evil force no one is the winner science and humanity become the villain everyone knows that but the gamblers want to play their cards be aware of the nuclear gamblers “ i hope that soon the world will be full of love and affection and there will be no place for hate and the wars will be held blackcoffer

52,imagine yourself as a being who can speak but no one can comprehend you you are kept in captivity in a place where you can hardly breathe you are finally selected and taken out of that place it is a happy moment for you you can finally have your freedom but sadly instead of being free you are prodded by rods and fed toxic substances against your will the only thing you can do is scream in vain your voice is heard by everyone but it gets lost in the noise of scientific advancement you writhe in pain as the substances take effect on your body the pain slowly creeps into your body and you slowly succumb to it never to wake up again since the time of aristotle animals have been subjected to various inhumane experiments for the sake of knowledge these experiments though unethical were very necessary for the advancement of science animal testing has become an important part of experimenting on living organisms to ensure that a product is safe for humans to consume the lab animals are generally subjected to high levels of toxicity while being kept in isolation due to which they have to suffer a lot of stress and discomfort animal testing has a large number of drawbacks animals and human beings react differently to certain substances for example in vioxx withdrew “rofexocib” after more than people suffered heart attacks after taking the drug although the drug showed no such effects during animal testing it posed threat to human beings it is very costly to conduct animal testing as animals need to be provided with shelter and food over a large period until the trials are completed animal testing might not lead to a scientific breakthrough there are various instances of animal testing failing to achieve the desired result which ultimately leads to loss of time resources and money some products like cosmetics may not be essential to humans and therefore do not require animal testing at all the cosmetic industry is notorious for animal testing of products and it is a pity that some of those products are not even launched in the market all of these things make us question ourselves is it even worth it is it possible to stop this cruelty without hampering our growth with the advancement in science it can be made possible that we do not have to use animals ever again advanced computing– with the availability of various software programs it has become easier to understand the working of a biological organism we can replicate the entire human body and conduct various tests to get generate simulations to assess the possible effects of a chemical or biological reaction for example cadd computer aided drug design is becoming popular for stimulating whether a particular drug affects the cells or not this cuts down the requirement of using animals for testing and also reduces the experimentation time as the researchers do not have to wait for the animals to show response tissue culture – growing tissues in petri dishes and in vitro cells can be a viable alternative to animal testing tissues and cells from brain liver kidney etc is taken from an animal and kept in a suitable growth medium for a few weeks or even for a year these cultures can be used to test the toxicity and efficacy of substances for example in eye irritancy tests new animals have to be used in each experiment to check if the substance is irritating the eye or not many animals permanently lose their eyesight and using a new animal every time is just simply inhumane using bovine corneal organ culture in which the corneal tissue is cultured for three weeks before using it yields the same result without any complications scientists have started to use this method to test for toxicity and efficacy in cosmetics drugs and chemical sectors d printing– making complex tissue structures from a single digital file is astonishing printing tissues can help in carrying out experiments on it and getting results similar to the real tissues for example earlier animal organs charts and d models were used to explain the functioning of a particular organ to medical students but now bio printing companies have started making human tissues and organs which are used by students in various medical schools to understand the intricacies of human organs which has helped in bringing down animal experimentation to a large extent these bio printed models can also be used by the researchers to conduct experiments on them without using animals for it a french company is working on a bio printed liver model to test liver toxicity without having to use animals at all this is a breakthrough in the field of bio technology as it can bring down animal experimentation by a large percentage organ on a chip method – it is a fairly new technology which consists of growing cells inside chips where they imitate the structure and behavior of human organs researchers can test drugs on these chips and it is far cheaper and humane than testing on animals for example uk company cn bio has come with a system which consists of organs on a single chip and they have tissues ranging from the liver to the brain micro dosing humans can participate in these experiments in which they are injected with small one time doses and are constantly monitored under imaging techniques to gather information on the changes happening in the body these tests can replace certain tests on animals and help in removing drug compounds that do not have the desired effect on the human body for example covid tests were carried on human volunteers in which they were given small doses of the vaccine and kept under constant surveillance this helped the researchers in removing the drugs that were not having the desired effect on the human body and thus they were also able to remove animal testing as one of the processes these alternatives can help in bringing down animal experimentation to a large extent if science can progress without harming animals then we should go for it rather than putting them through excruciating pain we must protect the animals as much as we can or else we would soon be living in a world without them blackcoffer insights eeshan singh and sowmya k

53,introduction the definition of consciousness has been controversial for centuries hence it is given the title of the ‘most familiar and yet mysterious aspects of our lives' an idea of this concept would be an awareness in beings of their surroundings themselves and their own perception the reason this part of our mind remains unascertained is that consciousness is not observable unlike brain matter that is studied scientifically the physical clarification of awareness is in a general sense incomplete it does not include what it feels to be the subject for the subject there likewise is by all accounts an unbridgeable illustrative gap between the physical world and our consciousness as suggested by an incident of eastern and shamir traditions consciousness is both universal and primal whilst we have made tremendous progress in understanding brain activity over the years this research has not been able to answer all the questions relating to the nature of emotions and experiences history beginning within the late nineteenth century this was a time that once had psychological queries driven by a philosophical understanding of the mind which was typically equated with consciousness as a result the analysis of brain and behavior naturally thought of the role of consciousness in behavioral management by the brain the ancient mayans were among the first to propose a sorted out feeling of each degree of consciousness its purpose and its worldly association with mankind since consciousness incorporates stimuli from nature as well as interior stimuli the mayans trusted it to be the most essential type of existence equipped for evolution the incas however thought about consciousness as a movement of mindfulness as well as of worry for others too john locke an early philosopher said that consciousness and so individuality are freelanced of all substances he also detected that there is no reason to believe that consciousness is stuck to any specific body or mind or that consciousness cannot be transferred from one body or mind to a different one karl marx another early thinker denies the mind body classification and holds that consciousness is jeopardized by the material eventualities of one's settings william james an american psychologist differentiated consciousness to a stream – unbroken and continuous despite several changes and shifts while the main center of a lot of the analysis moved to strictly note cable behaviors throughout the primary half of the twentieth century analysis of human consciousness has grown staggeringly after the s in sigmund freud's psychoanalytic theory we can see that he believed that all three levels of awareness preconscious conscious and unconscious were responsible for one's behavior and thinking he believed that the mid itself was divided into three parts the id the ego and the superego the id is present at birth instinctual and operates according to the pleasure principle the ego underseals reality and logic and develops out of the id in infancy finally the superego is an internalization of society's moral standards and responsible for guilt now the id is regarded as unconscious whereas the ego and superego are also conscious and preconscious freud constantly revised his own clinical qualities researches however and did not conduct scientific experiments and hence his work is heavily scrutinized leaving the questions unanswered sigmund freud's theory differed from the other psychologists since his theories were more understandable and very easily conveyed to the people sigmund freud's work and hypotheses helped people shape their perspectives on youth character memory sexuality and therapy however his theories were subject to considerable criticism both now and during his own life whilst john locke and william james took a more practical approach to the mystery by conducting experiments sigmund freud did not provide any evidence to support his claims brain today the essential focal point of consciousness research is on understanding what consciousness implies both biologically and mentally issues of interest include phenomena such as perception blindsight brainwaves during sleep and altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs a greater part of the test assesses consciousness by approaching human subjects for a verbal report of their encounters however to confirm the criticalness of these verbal reports researchers must contrast them with the action that all the while happens in the brain —that is they should search for the neural connections of consciousness hope is to locate that noticeable action in a specific aspect of the brain or a particular pattern of global brain activity will be greatly predictive of consciousness mindfulness a few brain imaging strategies for example eeg and mri scans have been utilized for physical proportions of brain activities in these examinations a few investigations have shown that movement in essential primary sensory areas of the brain is not adequate to create consciousness it is workable for subjects to report an absence of awareness in any event when areas for example the primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions to a stimulus higher brain areas are viewed as all the more encouraging particularly the prefrontal cortex which is involved in a range of high order functions one mainstream theory implicates various examples of brain waves in creating various conditions of consciousness analysts can record mind waves or drawings of electrical movement inside the cerebrum using an electroencephalograph eeg and placing electrodes on the scalp the four types of brain waves alpha beta theta and delta each correspond with one mental state relaxed alert lightly asleep and deeply asleep memory episodic memory can be regarded as the only form of conscious memory this is because it is the capacity to consciously remember personally experienced events and situations in the past the hippocampus located in the brain's temporal lobe is responsible for this type of memory consciousness also plays a part in important memory distinctions one such distinction is the implicit and explicit characteristics in which explicit memory is what you consciously know and implicit memory includes events you may not be conscious of furthermore several empirical findings suggest that declarative memory is related to consciousness as well meaning that the retrieval and formation of this memory are connected to awareness working memory operates maintains consciously perceived information as well since it temporarily stores and tampers with information whilst working on tasks the current ways of testing this information are lacking in several essential aspects including spatial resolution temporal resolution or scope examples of such methods are pet fmri eeg implanted electrodes etc pet and fmri have temporal resolution problems eeg is well known to have localizability difficulties and implanted electrodes whilst great in temporal and spatial resolution can only test a set number of neurons that is they are restricted in scope hence huge numbers of our speculations while testable on a fundamental level appear to be difficult to test as of now mental illness consciousness has an influence on the way we see objects around us which encourages us to settle on choices about how to communicate with them experiencing difficulty perceiving objects is connected to a few problems for example agnosia a failure to decipher visual data alzheimer's disease and autism however we actually do not comprehend what visual data is basic for the mind to intentionally perceive an object several different disorders of consciousness include locked in syndrome minimally conscious state persistent vegetative state chronic coma and brain death locked in syndrome otherwise called pseudo coma is a condition wherein a patient is aware however cannot move or impart verbally because of complete loss of motion of essentially all voluntary muscles in the body aside from vertical eye developments and squinting the individual is conscious and is able to speak with eye movements in a minimally conscious state the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness patients need to give restricted however reproducible indications of consciousness of themself or their current circumstance this could be following straightforward orders comprehensible speech or purposeful conduct in a persistent vegetative state the patient has sleep wake cycles but lacks awareness is not able to communicate and only displays reflexive and non purposeful behavior the term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourse like coma chronic coma results generally from cortical or white matter harm after neuronal or axonal injury or from central brainstem sores usually the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to of the normal range the patient lies with eyes shut and does not know about self or environmental factors brain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity and function including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life the main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation after brain death the patient lacks any sense of awareness sleep wake cycles or behavior and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep state future predictions and conclusion as we can see from the history of scholar's endeavors to study consciousness empirically its nature is not one that can be defined using scientific methods in the past psychologists such as descartes came up with dualistic theories that did not line up with the fundamental laws of physics in the battle between realists and illusionists taking sides is fundamentally impossible as the topic does not allow for concrete evidence as we can observe from neural examinations of the brain to detect the causes of consciousness there is no sensory sector of the brain that is the cause for one to be aware during a certain event even if there are clear signs of a reaction to a stimulus similarly even though consciousness plays a major role in memory we currently lack the facilities to research it fully in the future there is a possibility that we will be able to access such facilities however which could allow us to find the neural connections and its ties to mental illness as well not only would this help several people by making us aware of the causes of our perspective on certain things but it would also give us a better chance of recognizing signs of possible mental illness or other issues beforehand as it seems researchers continue to study this unknown part of our mind and once we are able to fund and recover from the global pandemic we will be able to answer one of psychology's most difficult questions

54,nature has blessed humanity with earth a rounded globe where all essential necessity lies in the hand of a human though in this st century building space shuttle and exploring space has become an obvious activity among the human raise now with the inclusion of start ups like space x once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true we all have to agree upon a fact that in the growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a much needed area for our survival with time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like dumping water and damaging water bodies somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing for all this idea for colonizing in outer space emerged when nasa was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late s this idea did not stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression space exploration was not a new normal companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for but things change with the entry of paypal's owner elon musk in where he laid stones of space x with nasa providing the launchpad for their exploration being space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing here one has to realize the optimum but the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology thus this unimaginable quest for the search of space was far fetched though now being in we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too proper planning analysing organising and executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how i would like to mention here an example of space x according to them they wud be successful for sending rockets by and would able to colonize by for achieving these vision they have planned a total of times pre launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of billion yearly by already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet with setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer space but the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust aspects like ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about trillian which is more than many countries gdp placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough elon to have addressed with these questions with an open door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heights also our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish because in the end we do not satisfy what we have achieved we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve that in order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage as of now we have searched planets but still did not shortlisted the outcomes but according to the decade theory of elon musk it seems to be possible as the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment whether is this suitable or not and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen the missions are now what everyone is focusing about finding the source of water because its nd crucial thing which is needed to survive apart from the excitement and the things the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that so the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicated after the basic things other factors like what are the natural habitats available there whether the plants could be grown over there or not if yes then what types of plants could survive there the environment for the animals is safe or not because to balance the nature we need all types of animals natural habitat even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance for e g – ants are among the leading predators of other insects helping to keep pest populations low ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground they keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter so every small thing contributes in its own way another matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement because as the current scenario we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics so the availability of the energy and the source of energy is needed and apart from this the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long so in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done when thinking about disease you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics such as penicillin – which help fight infections – may eventually stop working global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics especially for conditions that are not serious this is because their overuse in recent years means that they are becoming less effective but still we can survive without antibiotics because there are ways of dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillin it might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon in some ways the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the international space station although it has not been formally tested some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronaut's body when on the moon could help stem some of the adverse effects like bone density and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the international space station by using the moon's indigenous material space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moon's surface once on the moon instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from earth experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satellite on earth we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere but out in the space we cannot rely on this type of protection and in order to make that protection it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achieve although till now the approximate value of the project is trillion but the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fare as once we are comfortable with all the resources securities for uncertainties risk analysis and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration then development will not take much time because to construct a building it take normally months which is totally acceptable but the main concern is the density of the land i e whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not and the type of land is adaptable for cultivation or nor although land can be converted into different types of cultivation but with the help of upgraded technology in order to transport the equipments on the regular basis a large amount of fuel is required and other factors as well and built the propellor depo for rocket landing building various infrastructure for the city

55,we have really done it this year like an insatiable glutton the law of averages has come home to roost we should have taken the hint when on the st of january people lost their lives in the jakarta floods what followed was like the highlights reel of a disaster movie franchise – a volcanic eruption in the philippines irrepressible bushfires in australia earthquakes in russia iran turkey india and china and speaking of china has brought home the fragile mortality of the human race into sharp focus as global covid deaths stoutly push past the grim million marks we have no choice but to question our place in the universe – are we the all conquering masters of our domain or mere tourists in a ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem is the human race on the ubiquitous three part literary arc that defines every story every life every civilization – ascent apex and descent maybe when michael jackson unveiled his moonwalk in or when barack obama stepped into the white house as president of the united states in or indeed when ms dhoni lifted the cricket world cup in we peaked as a species and everything since then has been a steady unraveling years is a long time for context the world population in ad was a mere million the fold explosion since then is unprecedented in history but we might just be at the tip of an iceberg though fertility rates are dropping and more and more people are foregoing the chance to have babies we might just have crossed the threshold – the population projections for the year is billion and for is a whopping billion somewhere out there malthus is cackling in his grave the year suddenly seems a long way off and this conversation seems ever more pertinent today the bulletin of atomic scientists is not optimistic – the famed doomsday clock they maintain is the closest to ‘midnight' our proximity to global catastrophe since its inception in global warming check the threat of nuclear war check ongoing pandemic check check check and yet hope floats for three reasons mankind may just have its back to the wall right now but there are three shoots of potential that might just help us make it to ad – the advent of a basket of disruptive technologies artificial intelligence bio enhancement genetic engineering the private sector focus on space exploration and terraforming and good old fashioned human resilience while the first two factors will no doubt be critical to human survival it is the third one that we must pin our hopes on – our long demonstrated history of surviving whatever nature the universe or our own self destructive tendency throws our way the next superman in the th century in the italian town of pisa an enterprising tinkerer developed the first eyeglasses for a local friar with weakening eyesight all of a sudden there existed an external device that could amplify our senses a tool that gave us an advantage in survival today lasik surgeries obviate the need for eyeglasses entirely hearing aids give the gift of auditory perception back to those who had gotten used to a world of muffled voices and unheard sounds the iphone routinely comes with an augmented reality tool that allows us to measure the length of objects in front of us but the real science starts where the imagination ends – augmented reality glasses smart wearables and virtual reality tools will be ubiquitous in the next few decades but what after that science has the answer and it is both thrilling and scary artificial intelligence has become the stuff of fable the filler for all questions left unanswered but ai combined with bio enhancement and genetic engineering might just lead to the evolution of what some are calling homo nouveau homo nouveau will be smarter faster more agile and better equipped to adapt to what promises to be a world that is vuca beyond our imaginations what might such a human being look like they might have a small chip embedded in their brain that utilizes artificial intelligence for enhanced sensory perception what does that mean it means that they would be able to see better focuses their attention for longer hears what they want to hear and communicate the appropriate reaction to the rest of the body through a chemical in the blood this ai chip would be able to demand the appropriate response from the body bio augmentation of limbs and organs internal and external would mean that what a person can or cannot do is no longer determined at birth but can simply be bought all of a sudden the average joe can run faster than usain bolt swim better than michael phelps

galactic dominance spacex led by its mercurial leader elon musk has been the leader here the spacex mars programme is based on a very simple premise – as the earth's closest planet in terms of distance and terrestrial conditions mars would be our best bet for colonization musk has invested billions of dollars in the mars space programme and remains a fervent believer in the concept and among tech visionaries musk is not alone jeff bezos the richest man in the world owns blue origin which simply aims to make spaceflight cheaper through incremental technological growth bezos who took an online retailer of books and turned it into an ever expanding behemoth is not a man who thinks small with more and more business leaders finding spaceflight and planetary colonization a tantalizing prospect there will inevitably be a concerted push to developing an actual colony on another planet and when the pull factor to this development starts hitting diminishing returns there will be the inevitable push factor as global warming and the possible increase in the eruption of pandemics begin to take their toll it might just become a more feasible option for people to find an alternate home if not on mars then on one of saturn's moons a human colony on mars sounds like a concept straight out of science fiction but so did a permanent station in antarctica until a few decades ago mount everest seemed like an unapproachable summit until someone went ahead and planted a flag at the peak today hundreds of people every year attempt the climb as spaceflight becomes more reasonable as the urge to explore supersedes the inertia of investment we become closer to our best chance of survival – leaving planet earth behind and finding another home perhaps one more forgiving of our follies the human spirit the introduction to this article includes an illustrative list of disasters and misfortunes that have struck the global community this year and yet we survive businesses surge ahead people adapt to a world of masks and social distancing the world goes on earthquakes tsunamis pandemics we have seen them all before and survived and the human race in its intrepid exploration of the world pushes onward and upward technological visionaries envision a future that the rest of us cannot see and then invest money in their vision gradually what seemed unthinkable suddenly becomes real – the moon landing is the best possible example of that google launched google glass as the first augmented reality wearable technology and suddenly we could foresee a future with smart eyewear while the product did not quite catch on that does not mean other companies are not trying bio augmentation is already a fast developing industry while crispr cas the “genetic scissors” is being held back only by regulatory bottlenecks how long before the prospect of fiddling with the gene code becomes not a luxury but a necessity the human spirit the tendency to survive and thrive at all costs will eventually win the human race will survive to of that there is no doubt the real question is will the person who exists in with bionic chips and a bio enhanced body structure and a

56,mr sakamoto is a bonsai artist lives downtown kyoto japan bonsai is a japanese art form that is the cultivation of small trees in a small or medium container he is in this field of business for the last ten years and he loves what he does on a daily basis people from different cities in japan come to buy his artwork but in the early stage of his business he was just another regular bosai artist his popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling his customer immediately loved him for this while buying a bonsai art he loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy after the digital revolution although his sales increased he was not happy he was not satisfied something is eating up his mind day by day he could not understand what is the reason behind his remorse a chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution it is the real life embodiment of customer engagement every business needs this feature will be an understatement because customer engagement is the base of any business the chatbot does the exact thing digitally it helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations mr sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now and now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years the rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot though he has a website and app to sell his bonsai art he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to he has trained his employees and apprentices but they are not providing the same service in the way he does he was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness he has done all that at affordable prices in no time let us understand the mr sakamoto's “mondai nai” perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problems building the trust with customers this is the fundamental and root cause for which mr sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place his stories are embedded with each art the product which he sells needs this story to be with it his stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the trust between them we all can agree on this one statement that trust is the most impactful aspect maybe the best of aspects in the relation between any customer and business owner whether the business is small medium or large target the millennial customer millennials a word that was not introduced before the generation which is stuck in between gen x and gen y a generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture they are the most targeted audience in this era what else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot it is easy less time consuming to use mr sakamoto is now one of the few gen x persons who can do business with the millennial so easily better human interactions mr sakamoto has some employees and apprentices he has trained them as per his needs but there is a limit they cannot deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does neither chatbot can do that exactly it will accurately follow the instructions not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too is there any more attribute he would care about that absolutely no service the most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability a chatbot is a perfect way to solve it for mr sakamoto's customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability but also it was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone all over the world mr sakamoto would not be happier for this feature scaling up business in globalization in the era of globalization what is more helpful than a chatbot it can be customized in any language it can be accessed by any human being residing in any part of the world and at the end of the day when that foreigner is happy with the buy and the felicitation and says “arigato” but in his own language at that moment he feels so warm and happy handling a lot of customers is really hard he assigned employees but the rate is growing fast so in the competition of the market mr sakamoto took the help of a chatbot now this automated customized application is handling a greater number of customers than his employees can do his business is growing exponentially now when you found out why mr sakamoto is happy and his

57,have you ever wondered what is common between sir alex ferguson pep guardiola and jose mourinho i know it might look a lame question especially to the ardent football followers at first instinct the answer is that they are regarded as the top managers in the football universe uclwinners but when given a closer look these managers were not that great when it came to their careers as football players any naïve observer can build a fallacy of causation and correlation that those who do not have a great career as a football player will go on to become a great football manager but is this restricted just to football mike brearley one of the greatest captains in the history of cricket and the author of the book the art of captaincy was not the prolific batsman of his time our former president a p j abdul kalam did not have a political background but was still appointed as the president of our country and went to become one of the finest presidents our country has ever had so can it be stated with confidence that great leaders need not be the expert in their respective fields let us understand the leadership role types of leaders and explore a few more perspectives before we arrive at a conclusion let us start by first understanding what or who is a leader a leader is not a position or a designation it is a virtue if employed correctly from a janitor to the ceo from a student to a researcher from a content writer to a philosopher everybody is a leader leadersareeverywhere so what are the virtues of a leader one of the famous personality trait theories the big personality trait theory is always linked closely with leadership as per the various researches the personality traits of extraversion openness and conscientiousness are associated with leaders more often than the other two traits not just these humble and empathetic are also considered as the adjectives that are frequently associated with leaders but nowhere is technical expertise related to a leader notsotechnical as stated by colin powell leadership is the art of accomplishing more than the science of management says is possible it'sart if leadership is an art and leaders are the artists then more or less the leaders can be viewed as directors of the films who are organizing arranging managing and directing the scenes another analogy for that can be the orchestra where the conductor is using the baton stick to set the rhythm of the band so is it necessary for the conductor to himself or herself by a great violinist no when it comes to the corporate sector the leader need not be an expert on the technology but should know how the technology functions so that he she can utilize it in the best possible way they can allocate the task of building technology to the right technical experts and how do the leaders identify the right person for that job or how do leaders know what qualities to look for in a person experience every great leader once started off as one of the frontline workers or at the bottom of the pyramid in the hierarchical structure even though they might not have had the technical expertise in their respective fields their visionary outlook their management skills and the experience they gathered helped them in achieving their targets leaders can always take the assistance of the subject matter experts to guide them in situations of technical difficulties as per the great man situational and trait theory of leadership leadership is innate to the person leadership though can be conditioned or can be brought out in a person by rewarding him great leaders show unconditional attachment towards their vision everyone knows how to read a map but which path to choose is not something that can be taught leaders give the direction or vision to the company and drive it closer to the target that the company wants to achieve leadership theories do not focus on the technical knowledge of the leaders but rather more on people skills their approach towards a problem and how well they guide and hire others to get the job done which is also evident as per the managerial skills required as per robert katz though it can be argued that technical experts are also the great leaders in their areas but these leaders are generally at the middle management level as per the different leadership styles a servant leader is the one who always tries to achieve the goal of the team these leaders are the ones who have a management objective laid out in front of them and they drive the team closer to achieving the target by having the people first mindset a collaborative approach towards solving the problem these are the people or the leaders needed at the execution level of the project or those who are too close to the employees at the bottom most level since the managers at the top of the pyramid do not get much time to invest in people they appoint the right people on their behalf to get the job done consider an it firm so as per the points mentioned above does it mean that a leader or the manager should not know how to code depends if the person is the first line manager then he or she should probably know how to code so that he or she can help the team in achieving the target of producing less garbage which might be one of the project's kpis the project manager who might be an operations manager mba from an it background probably need not know what line of code is to be written but should know the algorithms or the logic behind the code so that he or she can validate the code from the client's perspective the ceo might not be from an it background but should know how to run an it firm rather than the syntax of the code but in today's competitive world leaders cannot be one dimensional they need to have expertise in multiple areas to be at the top mike brearley if got a chance to play a t match will not even get picked into aside not because of his age but because of his not so great looking batting statistics thegamehaschanged his leadership skills will not be enough to get him into the squad but he can be a great leader if selected to coach the top captains in the world today as we have already discussed the film directors their job is not to teach the cameramen on how to set up or operate lens settings etc the camera their job is to guide the cameramen on what angle it should be held and how he or she should coordinate with the lights crew so that a perfect shot is captured so even if a leader may not be a technical expert of his field but if he or she has the right approach and mindset understands the system and its process then he or she can hire the best talent for the job and can get the work done by guiding the talent with his or her vision so the answer to the question which we came across in the first paragraph is yes and no depending upon the position in the hierarchy yes for a front line manager and no for a cxo and the type of the leader you are the level of technical expertise needed varies though as stated earlier by robert katz the cxo's need to have the least amount of technical expertise the cxo should know how the technology functions or what are the applications what processes are to be followed to build the technology he or she should now what is to be done rather than how it is to be done itsnothowitswhat otherwise even though the company might be sitting on a gold mine but if the leader is not aware of that or is not learned enough to know what to do with it no company can succeed even with having all the resources at their disposal leaders command respect and do not demand it and that is possible when they give value to their front line employees seek timely advice from the technical experts and put the resources to the best of its uses otherwise you will be surrounded by technical experts like dilberts dilbert blackcoffer insights rohan mehta symbiosis institute of operations management,58,wondered common sir alex ferguson

58,the word “leadership” can bring to mind a variety of images for example a political leader pursuing a passionate personal cause or an executive developing his her company's strategy to beat the competition leaders help themselves and others to do the right things they set direction build an inspiring vision and create something new leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to “win” as a team or an organization and it is dynamic exciting and inspiring in my point of view we cannot become a good leader without technical expertise because every task in the organization it is required a lot of skills knowledge consistent enthusiastic patience motivating inspiring industrious and critical thinking on the basis of the field we are doing a leader should have the ability to motivate self and others effective oral and written communication critical thinking skills at the working team and delegating a task good leaders do have these abilities and if we wanted to create a future leader they need to take in a large volume of information and to take the essential elements that define the core problem to solve they need to organize a team to solve these problems and to communicate to a group they need to established trust with a group and use the trust to allow the team to accomplish the work more than it could be done alone though all these skills we have but it is would not sufficient to make us a great leader because to excel and utilize these abilities in practice we need a lot of technical expertise in a particular domain for example like in a hospital if the head of the hospital is lead by other people rather than doctor then the hospital would become worse at a point because the person from other fields he could not lead and understand the real scenario and mechanism that the hospital is functioning and he would not understand the staff and the patient as well hence to lead the hospital doctor is deserved who knows his own field how to lead and understand the real scenario of it that is why being a leader requires technical expertise to have great knowledge and understanding about his own organization every person if they want to become a leader they should have technical expertise on their own organization so that their organization would run smoothly hence nobody could run other organization if we do not have the technical expertise on that field so be a leader not a boss which makes your life much better as they are a saying that “ a good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even better ” blackcoffer insights caldinus nongrang nit meghalaya,17,word “leadership” bring mind variety images political leader pursuing passionate personal executive developing company's strategy beat competition leaders things set direction build inspiring vision create leadership mapping “win” team organization dynamic exciting inspiring point view good leader technical expertise task organization required lot skills knowledge consistent enthusiastic patience motivating inspiring industrious critical thinking basis field leader ability motivate effective oral written communication critical thinking skills working team delegating task good leaders abilities wanted create future leader large volume information essential elements define core problem solve organize team solve problems communicate group established trust group trust team accomplish work skills sufficient make great leader excel utilize abilities practice lot technical expertise domain hospital head hospital lead people doctor hospital worse point person fields lead understand real scenario mechanism hospital functioning understand staff patient lead hospital doctor deserved field lead understand real scenario leader requires technical expertise great knowledge understanding organization person leader technical expertise organization organization run smoothly run organization technical expertise field leader boss makes life “ good objective leadership poorly ” blackcoffer insights caldinus nongrang nit meghalaya,9,4,0.3846153550295881,178,0.07303370745486681,10.470588235294118,10.470588235294118,125,70.2247191011236,32.27812293456709,2.404494382022472,7.056179775280899,8
59,when we talk about ai different people have different perspectives about it there is one group of people having good knowledge about the real potential of ai who believe that ai can be a novel solution to many problems that the world is facing today there is another group of people who are merely threatened by the thought of ai taking over the world the field of ai took birth when alan turing in had this thought “can machines think ” later in the s with the adoption of “expert systems” by the companies around the world the booming of the field of ai was initiated initially it was a matter of awe for everyone to see the results of what ai can achieve ai's growth in the past few decades has been exponential and it has transformed the way we live work and solve challenges ai has made its impact in a wide variety of areas including healthcare education business and many more but one of the areas of highest impact that ai has made recently is in the environment and climate change is ai revolutionizing the way we deal with environment and climate change ai can strengthen climate predictions enable smarter decision making for decarbonising industries from building to transport and work out how to allocate renewable energy in recent years ai has been a game changer in how many people as well as organizations deal with climate change microsoft believes that artificial intelligence often encompassing machine learning and deep learning is a “game changer” for climate change and environmental issues the company's ‘ai for earth' program has committed million over five years to create and test new applications for ai ai is increasingly used to manage the intermittency of renewable energy so that more can be incorporated into the grid it can handle power fluctuations and improve energy storage as well wind companies are using ai to get each turbine's propeller to produce more electricity per rotation by incorporating real time weather and operational data ai can also improve energy efficiency on the city scale by incorporating data from smart meters and the internet of things the internet of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects enabling them to send and receive data to forecast energy demand besides artificial intelligence systems can simulate potential zoning laws building ordinances and flood plains to help with urban planning and disaster preparedness one vision for a sustainable city is to create an “urban dashboard” consisting of real time data on energy and water use and availability traffic and weather to make cities more energy efficient and livable hotter temperatures will have significant impacts on agriculture as well data from sensors in the field that monitor crop moisture soil composition and temperature help ai improve production and know when crops need watering incorporating this information with that from drones which are also used to monitor conditions can help increasingly automatic ai systems know the best times to plant spray and harvest crops and when to head off diseases and other problems this will result in increased efficiency enhanced yields and lower use of water fertilizer and pesticides but is ai as good as it looks or does it have a downside when we talk about the effect of ai in the environment and climate both sides of the coin must be elucidated so apart from all the positives discussed above the usage of ai also has a downside last year's world economic forum report showed that while ai can address some of earth's environmental challenges it is important to manage it properly according to the forum and experts in the field ai has the potential to accelerate environmental degradation the use of power intensive gpus to run machine learning training has already been cited as contributing to increased c emissions although ai has been around for about half a century the question of environmental impact – and other ethical issues – is only arising now because the techniques developed over decades can now be used in combination with an explosion in data and strong computational power for all the advances enabled by artificial intelligence from speech recognition to self driving cars ai systems consume a lot of power and can generate high volumes of climate changing carbon emissions a study last year found that training an off the shelf ai language processing system produced pounds of emissions – about the amount produced by flying one person roundtrip between new york and san francisco but there are ways to make machine learning cleaner and greener a movement that has been called “green ai ” some algorithms are less power hungry than others for example and many training sessions can be moved to remote locations that get most of their power from renewable sources the key however is for ai developers and companies to know how much their machine learning experiments are spewing and how much those volumes could be reduced what can be done to prevent this the proposition by the world economic forum report is that advancements in “safe” ai should be pursued to ensure that humanity is not developing ai that is harmful to the environment specifically the world economic forum said in its report that ai developers “must incorporate the health of the natural environment as a fundamental dimension ” this means safeguarding against models that will demand the consumption of energy or natural resources beyond what is sustainable among other factors in a sense all programs need to be designed with the dimension of environmental protection and improvement in mind in the future development of ai programs it will also be important to note the environmental impact of creating these systems in the first place according to an academic study on energy usage for deep learning processes the creation of an effective ai might be costly to the environment nearly kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are created during the process of training a single model this is basically equal to the emissions of five average cars in the united states considering the negative environmental impact in addition to the positive implications of ai and climate change will be crucial moving forward there is always room for improvement some pioneers of machine learning recently published a paper called tackling climate change with machine learning was discussed at a major ai conference david rolnick a postdoctoral fellow of the university of pennsylvania said “call to arms” which means to bring researchers together this paper covers thirteen areas of research where machine learning can be used including energy production co removal education solar geoengineering finance and many more the main idea is to build more energy efficient buildings creating new low carbon materials high tech monitoring of deforestation and greener transportation sources artificial intelligence and machine learning can be a medium but the real work is to be done by us as a caretaker of mother earth how about better forecasting of climate change the kick start was already done by climate informatics in which regulates the collaboration of data science and climate science it covers a wide range of topics like improving prediction of extreme events such as hurricanes paleoclimatology collecting data from ice cores climate up down scaling and its impact on us “there's a lot of uncertainty ” monteleoni claire monteleoni a computer science professor at the university of colorado concludes that ai ml models generally forecast for the short term there is a significant difference when it comes to long term forecasting the first system was developed at princeton in the s all the ai ml models developed till now revolve around atmosphere oceans land cryosphere or ice ai can help to achieve new heights with the amount of data collected at this point of time and compute more complex climate conditions using climate modeling algorithms what about showing the effects of extreme weather we all know that climate change is real and the rise in atmospheric temperature the proof but to make it more realistic montreal institute of learning algorithms mila microsoft and conscientai labs uses generative adversarial networks popularly know as gans to simulate what mother earth will look like with the rising sea levels atmospheric temperature air pollution and intensive storms “our goal is not to convince people climate change is real it is to get people who do believe it is real to do more about that ” said victor schmidt a co author of the paper and ph d candidate at mila the project is deployed for the people to look at what their places will look like in the future when there will be a significant climate change can we track carbon emissions short answer yes tracking of carbon emission is one of the agendas of the un for this year the un's goal is to prevent new coal plants from being built satellite images come into picture using deep learning techniques data science researchers can analyze these high quality satellite images and track the emission google is expanding its horizon of nonprofit's satellite imagery including gas powered plants emissions which can be used by researchers to track the pollution there are countries organizations which govern co emission on the ground level but these data are unreachable by global monitoring associations ai can automate the analysis of images of power plants to get regular updates on emissions it also introduces new ways to measure a plant's impact by crunching numbers of nearby infrastructure and electricity use that is beneficial for gas powered plants that do

60,no one can reduce mistakes to zero but you can learn to harness your drive to prevent them and channel it into better decision making use these tips to become a more effective worrier do not be afraid or ashamed of your fear our culture glorifies fearlessness the traditional image of a leader is one who is smart tough and unafraid but fear like any emotion has an evolutionary purpose and upside your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that we are in a challenging situation a cautious leader has value this is especially true in times like these so do not get caught up in ruminating “i should not be so fearful ” do not be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and do not interpret it as evidence that you are an indecisive leader or not bold not visionary if you have a natural tendency to be prevention focused channel it to be bold and visionary if you struggle to believe this identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters use emotional agility skills fear of mistakes can paralyze people emotional agility skills are an antidote to this paralysis this process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings such as “i feel anxious i'm not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe ” stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them it is like turning the light on in a dark room next comes accepting reality for example “i understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways ” list off every truth you need to accept then comes acting your values let us say one of your highest values is conscientiousness how might that value apply in this situation for example it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have identify your five most important values related to decision making in a crisis then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face repeat this process for each of your fears it will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action is not clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero focus on your processes worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively most people do not when you worry it should be solutions focused not just perseverating on the presence of a threat direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure we can control systems not outcomes what are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes direct your worries into answering questions like these is the data you are relying on reliable what are the limitations of it how do your systems help prevent groupthink what procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots how do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders what are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences broaden your thinking when we are scared of making a mistake our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario imagine you are out walking at night you are worried about tripping so you keep looking down at your feet next thing you know you have walked into a lamp post or imagine the person who is scared of flying they drive everywhere even though driving is objectively more dangerous when you open the aperture it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there this can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most it might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes but this strategy can help kick you into problem solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you a leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing they do not realize that other people care most about something else find out what other people's priorities are recognize the value of leisure fear grabs us it makes it difficult to direct our attention away this is how it is designed to work so that we do not ignore threats some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance they want to be on guard at their command post at all times this might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work that type of adrenalin fueled behavior can have short term value but it can also be myopic a different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking we need leisure and sleep to step back integrate the threads of our thinking see blindspots and think creatively get some silent time although much maligned a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically detach from judgment clouding noise as mentioned when people are fearful they can go into always on monitoring mode you may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing to always be on social media or check data too frequently this can result in information overload your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down recognize if you are doing this and limit over monitoring or over checking avoid panicked frenzied behavior on its own being afraid of making mistakes does not make you more or less likely to make good decisions if you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels you might make do or say the wrong things however if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level you can use it to motivate careful but bold and well reasoned choices blackcoffer insights harsh arya abhishek kumar singh akgec

61,what is perfection really does every person expect perfection from oneself or someone else or is it in certain amounts many times the certain question comes to the mind when we think about what we deem perfect but how do we verify it let us understand this through the work of three individuals who know are to be put on a task in carpentry on a budget all are given rs assumed to complete this task they cannot go beyond this budget manish vinay and sameer need to make a stool for themselves each manish has no understanding of carpentry he learns from youtube vinay took his carpentry lessons during engineering so he has a practical idea of how to make a stool but sameer is a carpenter so he has a total understanding of the material process and final product let us start with manish understand that the task is to get their jobs done manish has two options here he can either order parts and assemble it himself or order the material required such as wood glue nails etc and then work on it before the assembly of the final product the only difference is his lack of expertise in this field vinay has the same options but has practical experience from his carpentry classes during the workshop in engineering sameer has an advantage since he has both skill and experience perfected over a course of time all three are given three days for the task since manish finds it easy to assemble the stool using parts procured from another carpenter he talks to a carpenter he knows and orders leg parts horizontal support bars and one circular base which will sit on the top vinay thinks he will be able to shape the parts because of his experience as a student and orders several cylindrical wooden leg parts cuboidal bars and a thick sheet sameer has all the required material in his shop and he begins to work on the stool on the first day manish and vinay wait for a day for the parts to come they begin to work on the second day manish uses the tricks learned from youtube videos uses a hammer to place the nails purchased from a nearby shop in the pre made hole applies glue in certain areas as directed in the video and places weight on the assembled stool he waits for the glue to cure vinay uses borrowed drill bits drill machines cutters sandpapers purchased from a shop etc and starts working on the wooden parts as soon as the parts arrive in the morning he is able to recall his carpentry instructions and attempts to shape the parts based on drawing of his product he made last night sameer meanwhile has completed his assembly and has put the assembly to rest for the glue to cure on the third day each of them has the stool ready they evaluate their own work and notice certain facts manish notices that he did complete the task but his stool was wobbly and not glued well it could fall the moment he sits on it also he forgets to polish the wooden parts and give it a professional finish since he forgot to watch that bit of video over youtube vinay completes the task his stool is sturdy and cured well overnight but there are minor issues with it one of the three legs is cut short by a few mm and the stool a tad unstable sameer on the other hand completes the task with a good product the stool is well balanced and polished as he expected from him sameer is satisfied with his work and finds it to stool perfect manish thinks he did his best considering he had no experience of the task to be done he is satisfied with his work but vinay is unhappy he could have done better and made the product better he does not find his efforts well put and thinks he was not productive enough and hence his stool is nowhere perfect understand that all of them had a set of skills and experience but only sameer had the right skills and experience to produce a perfect product manish and sameer were satisfied and happy with their work manish made a wobbly stool which could break the moment someone sat on it but happy he gave the task a go he thinks put the efforts and he did a good job it was only vinay who could not overcome the fact that his work was not perfect in vinay's case it can be observed that he could not deliver what he learned from carpentry classes the reason is simple he put effort but did not have the experience experience mattered since vinay thinks otherwise he believes he has the perfect skills to complete the task but he could not deliver the results he is not satisfied with his results and wishes to spend another day working on the stool on his own to get to his idea of the perfect result in this case the idea of perfection itself is misplaced you see the end product made by vinay and manish would not match sameer's but the task could have been completed had they understood where their shortcomings lied for both it was their skill sameer had the perfect skill to get the expected result which resulted in better productivity others did not and in this story every individual put effort regardless of the result but some were satisfied and some dissatisfied their satisfaction made their creations perfect in their eyes and dissatisfaction made one believe he was not productive enough “perfection is subjective and productivity is utility extracted given a certain amount of effort” you can try to be as productive to achieve something but ultimately it is the satisfaction you get that defines the boundary of perfection if you are not satisfied you will not find anything perfect you would just waste both your time and effort over something that does not suit you in the first place as explained in the story before “it is not productivity that will be the greatest enemy but your satisfaction” satisfaction will determine how you perceive perfection and defines where your threshold for perfection lies the real enemy is dissatisfaction you get demotivated and restless you lose sight and discontinue only because you are unable to pass your own expectation so it is the only obstacle that comes in between productivity from time to time productivity is far from being your enemy the greatest enemy will be your expectations which lead to dissatisfaction it will play a major role in crafting your idea of perfection in every day blackcoffer insights jude francis institute of management technology imt nagpur,73,perfection person expect perfection oneself amounts times question mind deem perfect verify

62,brief the financial crisis of started as a crisis in the subprime mortgage market i e in a market where lending of loans is done to people who may have difficulty in maintaining the repayment schedule or in simple terms loans were given out to people without proper checks and low credit scores which ultimately led onto a huge global collapse the financial crisis of or great recession is considered the worst economic crisis since the great depression financial crisis explained – in the year there was a dot com boom or otherwise known as the dot com bubble in the united states a period of massive growth in the use of the internet because of which the stock market prices started increasing rapidly however around the year it dropped which led people and investors to withdraw their investments from the stock market rapidly it led to the decline of the price of shares in stock markets and the interest rate plummeted to around very quickly in a short span investors were now looking for a brighter option than investing in stock markets fig – rise and fall of the dot com bubble as interest rates went lower and lower real estate prices started rising and the us govt also encouraged people to buy houses and properties the demand for the same started rising rapidly and investors now found a great option to invest in i e in real estate during that same time investment banks saw an opportunity chimed in and started buying loans from banks in bulk and clubbed multiple loans under a complex derivative called cdo collateralized debt obligations and started providing it to these investors after getting a credit rating of “aaa” very safe investment from the credit rating agencies investors naturally fell for it and started buying these cdos so now the risk factor of these loans got transferred from the banks to the investment banks and then again to the cdo investors with the high buying demand of cdos investment banks started demanding or pressurizing banks to provide even more loans so that they can provide more cdos to the investors however banks had already provided loans to people with good credit history and regular income people but in the hope of getting even more credit from investment banks these same banks then started giving out subprime housing loans to people with low credit scores approximately bn worth of loans were given out during the period and most of them were clubbed as cdos with a “aaa” rating from the credit rating agencies approximately of these cdo's were marked with a “aaa” rating investment banks and credit rating agencies were now enjoying large profits during this time moody's a credit rating agency profits increased x times during that period looking at the huge profits being made by the investment banks and credit rating agencies insurance companies like aig now started giving out insurance on these cdos to the investors and they called it cds credit default swap aig believed that since the cdos were rated as “aaa” very safe investment the failure chances of these cdos were very minimal they misjudged or were unaware of the fact that some of the loans that were clubbed under these cdos were sub prime loans now cdo investors started buying out cds from aig and other companies to safeguard and protect them from any losses aig then started making huge profits because of the premiums that the investors had to pay but they never realized the outcome if by any chance the cdos fail at some point in time thus the risk factor again got transferred from the cdo investors to the insurance companies fig – flow diagram showing how the risk factors got transferred coming to the loan borrowers now sub prime borrowers from banks were unaware of the fact of adjustable rate loans interest rate of these loans keeps changing and thus had to pay lower interests at the start but more interest rates later on the borrowers started defaulting on these loans when the interest rates increased dramatically around and thus banks had to then resell those houses to make up for the loans defaulted added to the problem was the fact that borrowers were not spending any amount of money from their pockets while taking loans and banks were providing the full amount of loans almost of the borrowers did not pay anything from their own pocket and bought the home only using the housing loan this led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back with the high interest rates and no one to buy the auctioned houses this ultimately caused a chain reaction and banks were no longer receiving credit the prices of real estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting because the price of their houses homes fell below the loan amount that they had taken earlier banks stopped receiving money and also because of this chain reaction the value of cdos ultimately came down to some investors went for huge losses and few investment companies went bankrupt ex – lehman brothers moreover insurance companies had to pay back those investors who had taken insurance as a result some of the insurance companies also went bankrupt aig too almost lost about bn in paying back the investors who had earlier insured their cdos however the us govt finally decided to bail out aig in order to save them from going bankrupt cdos and cdss were not regulated during that time by the federal reserve and thus this whole situation ultimately led to credit crunch became very difficult to get loans and the whole economy of the us underwent a crisis that led to a global impact all around the world unemployment increased manifold and many new businesses had to shut down global trades all around the world also saw a crisis and finally global recession hit the world causes of the crisis – improper screening of loan borrowers resulting in subprime loan borrowers which included even borrowers with no stable income credit rating agencies rated all the cdos highly and investors were purchasing without proper monitoring the same goes for insurance companies lax regulation of cdos and cds' by federal reserve banks the large size of interbank lending that compounded the crisis effects of the crisis – house prices plummeted the unemployment rate increased all over the us and the eu m people lost jobs globally m business devastated m houses foreclosed approx bn losses banks and investment banks combined ways to avoid such crisis in future – tighter regulations on loan screenings regulations to prevent banks from growing too big and preventing systemic risks addressing ‘too big to fail' problem borrowers must be made aware of rate adjustable loans credit rating agencies should not rate the cdos without proper risk assessment partnership with fintech companies to develop robust alternative credit scoring models for people with

63,gender diversity is an equal representation of all genders in workplaces one of the most important sectors where there is under representation of gender diversity is the technological industry gender diversity means you have an equal opportunity which is not limited by gender but the true reality is gender diversity is a far outcry in the world gender diversity is not a new topic but an old and global phenomenon and technology industry is not a stranger to it women are often underrepresented in the technology sector to understand the gap let us look at some statistics the percentage of women employed across all job sectors in the us has grown to be out of belong to the top technology companies amazon apple facebook google and microsoft women software engineer hires have only increased over the last years of women said they have experienced gender discrimination at work only of tech startups have at least one woman on the board of directors the ratio of men to women in engineering is of google's leaders on a global scale are women even in the tech conference organizations there were fewer female keynote speakers than male speakers eight percent to percent of gay and transgender workers report being passed over for a job or fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity globally women only earn cents to the dollar when compared to men according to a mckinsey global institute report if women were to play an identical role in labor markets to that of men as much as trillion or could be added to the global annual gdp by according to unesco over billion women are legally restricted from having the same choice of jobs as men and women's labor force participation rate is compared to a rate of for men after looking at these staggering numbers we see how biased gender diversity is even in the technological sector need of the hour with rapid industrialization and education about the importance of rights gender diversity is very important in today's world gender equality represents a society that has lesser violence and provides a safer world for everyone it is also directly proportional to sustainable development and ensures human rights to everyone as today's markets are increasing along with customers' preferences to understand customer profiles and build products we need gender diversity in our organizations equal representation helps in a better decision making process for a positive impact men and women invest back into their families and having gender equality and diversity helps build values into families and households empowering individuals not only help themselves but also the economy of the nations gender equality and diversity should be built into organizations' beliefs and values global gender gap report why is this happening perception if we see the word “gender” it is a socially constructed definition and this definition changes as per different cultural norms in a much broader term our society is also not aware of the concept of binary and non binary gender which includes queer trans and intersex individuals as well the socially acceptable thing is to have gender expressions as per our gender identity so when it comes to choosing their career people tend to choose a job role that gives them higher social belongingness e g we see more women as compared to men in nursing careers as it requires more feminine qualities there are different versions of this perception which we can see either in the society in terms of socially assigned gender roles or in the workplace in the form of gender discrimination stereotypical thinking sexism etc e g as per their assigned roles in society women are most likely to take care of their family and children and this affects their income and career growth the motherhood penalty is a term defined by sociologists which states about the inverse correlation between income level and the number of children i e there is also an income difference between a mother and a non mother employee as per oecd data there is a reduction in wages for women per child lack of economic opportunities even in the tech industry women are paid less than men as per ilo data on average women are paid less than men worldwide even when it comes to promotion men are preferred more it is to be noted that the numbers are even worse when there is intersectionality involved e g a transgender woman will be paid less than a white woman and so on as per the national centre for transgender equality one out of two transgender people faces adverse effects including were denied a promotion were passed over for a particular job position and are fired from their workplace just because they are transgender ways to improve gender diversity we can improve this scenario from the perspective of different stakeholders who are involved for society creating tech awareness from school level as per the hdr report no of boys pursuing stem program is higher than girls one way to improve this is to introduce more strong role models to advocate for this issue minority gender communities should be aware of the multiple job opportunities and career growth available in this field these job roles are not even gender specific anymore for developing countries like india stem scholarship programs can be introduced from the secondary education level address bias stereotypes it is to be noted that perceptions stereotypes and biases are not just something we learn in school but our upbringing also creates these the things we watch listen and read daily so it also becomes the duty of the society to create a more inclusive environment e g a more privileged person should fight for the fundamental right of the less empowered or less privileged person in society there should be active encouragement from parents teachers and educators for students in stem programs regardless of their gender identity for companies to promote gender diversity in the workplace companies need to focus on three things unbiased recruitment policies generally there is a lot of unconscious bias and prejudices when hiring women trans intersex and queer individuals there needs to be a diversity and inclusivity team in the hr itself that addresses these issues a blind recruitment drive can be conducted where there is no need to mention gender in any of the documents having structured questions during the interview might help to remove any unconscious biases diversity sensitivity training workplace policies need to create a company image that hires everyone irrespective of their gender identity and can even keep it optional in all the job formalities and documents conducting proper sensitivity training to employees is essential as they need to use correct pronoun gender neutral language not just sensitivity training strong workplace policies need to be in place which deal with any form of harassment or gender discrimination to create accountability and transparency in their process companies can also share diversity and inclusivity company data retention policies creating mentorship models have a mentorship program in the workplace that advocates for women trans intersex and non binary individuals as leaders and encourages role models within this community need to promote diversity in the workplace via proper workplace policies and legal guidelines e g conducting mandatory sensitization training for all employees or framing zero tolerance policies including proper maternity leaves child care facilities and flexibility of working hours remote working arrangements can be helpful for minority gender in keeping their work life balance develop support programs for these communities who are joining after maternity leave it might be in terms of psychiatric or mentorship support increase pay parities it can be done in the following ways create flexibility in job roles so that women can move on to higher positions build an inclusive workplace that supports pay parity— no salary difference based on gender for the same job roles create a transparent performance review process and ensure that there are no unconscious biases during the recruitment process doing a pay review within the organization to check how much pay difference exists before making framing policies lastly there needs to be proper government policies in place which provide a constitutional or legal framework starting from the basic education level it may begin from increasing the gross enrollment rates of all students in schools irrespective of their gender identity for developing countries like india to have proper compensation policies in the workplace as similar to what states like california new york has adopted to ensure pay parity blackcoffer insights sushmitha sujatha iim kozhikode,94,gender diversity equal representation genders workplaces important sectors representation gender diversity technological

64,the covid crisis and its fallout including recession layoffs and uneven economic pain as well as recent protests over police brutality and demands for racial justice have presented many of us with challenges that we have not encountered before the high stakes and unfamiliar nature of these situations have left many people feeling fearful of missteps no one can reduce mistakes to zero but you can learn to harness your drive to prevent them and channel it into better decision making use these tips to become a more effective worrier do not be afraid or ashamed of your fear our culture glorifies fearlessness the traditional image of a leader is one who is smart tough and unafraid but fear like any emotion has an evolutionary purpose and upside your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that we are in a challenging situation a cautious leader has value this is especially true in times like these so do not get caught up in ruminating “i should not be so fearful ” do not be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and do not interpret it as evidence that you are an indecisive leader or not bold not visionary if you have a natural tendency to be prevention focused channel it to be bold and visionary if you struggle to believe this identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters use emotional agility skills fear of mistakes can paralyze people emotional agility skills are an antidote to this paralysis this process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings such as “i feel anxious i'm not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe ” stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them it is like turning the light on in a dark room next comes accepting reality for example “i understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways ” list off every truth you need to accept then comes acting your values let us say one of your highest values is conscientiousness how might that value apply in this situation for example it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have identify your five most important values related to decision making in a crisis then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face repeat this process for each of your fears it will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action is not clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero focus on your processes worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively most people do not when you worry it should be solutions focused not just perseverating on the presence of a threat direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure we can control systems not outcomes what are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes direct your worries into answering questions like these is the data you are relying on reliable what are the limitations of it how do your systems help prevent groupthink what procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots how do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders what are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences broaden your thinking when we are scared of making a mistake our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario imagine you are out walking at night you are worried about tripping so you keep looking down at your feet next thing you know you have walked into a lamp post or imagine the person who is scared of flying they drive everywhere even though driving is objectively more dangerous when you open the aperture it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there this can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most it might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes but this strategy can help kick you into problem solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you a leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing they do not realize that other people care most about something else find out what other people's priorities are recognize the value of leisure fear grabs us it makes it difficult to direct our attention away this is how it is designed to work so that we do not ignore threats some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance they want to be on guard at their command post at all times this might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work that type of adrenalin fueled behavior can have short term value but it can also be myopic a different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking we need leisure and sleep to step back integrate the threads of our thinking see blindspots and think creatively get some silent time although much maligned a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically detach from judgment clouding noise as mentioned when people are fearful they can go into always on monitoring mode you may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing to always be on social media or check data too frequently this can result in information overload your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down recognize if you are doing this and limit over monitoring or overchecking avoid panicked frenzied behavior on its own being afraid of making mistakes does not make you more or less likely to make good decisions if you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels you might make do or say the wrong things however if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level you can use it to motivate careful but bold and well reasoned choices blackcoffer insights harsh arya abhishek kumar singh,72,covid crisis fallout including

65,the word pandemic may be the most used word for the last decade and we know why the year comes with a lot of unprecedented threats to humans as well as to nature while no business was left insulated from its effect small businesses were one of the most affected as they rely on day to day sales and keep the inventory minimum based on the demand of customers and have a low margin to maneuver in an article by hsbc's navigator which described the preparedness and contingency plan for the future indian business rated high among its peers the businesses in india have shown resilience to face adversity which can be attributed to varying degrees of adjustment and adaptability the businesses while able to adhere to government guidelines have managed to facilitate their customers efficiently and effectively however the impact on micro small and medium enterprises cannot be left unattended the indian subcontinent has an estimated ₹ lakh of msme out of which are in rural areas which employ of the total employment provided by this sector the msme sector with lakh people constitutes of the total workforce as per the ministry of commerce msme contribution in gross domestic product gdp and export are and respectively with the huge contribution toward gdp as well as export the impact on the national economy due to the shock in the msme sector from the pandemic will be equally devastating while different businesses face different types of obstacles we have pointed out of the most common issues faced by them low working capital small businesses usually have a low working capital ratio which means that they do not have enough capital to finance their daily requirements in these difficult times this problem has gone to the next level as they will have obligations to pay but due to less or no revenue for a few months there are high chances that they may not be able to meet them low cash cycle according to a survey done by economic times they have found that small businesses usually run on a days cash cycle and due to pandemic looming around they are not able to operate efficiently more than half of the small businesses of the country have either exhausted their funds or are close to doing so it is because of the unprecedented demand crash due to lockdown not registered many of the small businesses in india are not registered as they are just too small and this invisibility is both an advantage and disadvantage for them being out of the formal system they do not have to maintain proper books of accounts pay the taxes and follow all the regulatory norms but the downside of this is that it is difficult for them to access government programs focused on them and make use of it difficult to get financial support it becomes a huge task for small businesses when it comes to getting loans this is because they do not have proper accounts and assets which they can keep as mortgage to get loans from banks due to this they have to use a traditional method of lending which involves a high rate of interest and during these times it is also getting difficult to get loans from this area existential crisis – with the abrupt change in the business environment the businesses either have low production or they cease to exist while low production will put a burden on the owner's pocket but if they closed their business and start fresh the cost of starting a new business post crisis will be high and with limited creditworthiness which makes business difficult to regain their lost market share migration in the starting days of lockdown small businesses were not able to pay their workers which led to migration as they moved back to their hometowns this has led to a problem of the availability of a suitable workforce for these businesses as they are trying to get things back to normal absence of skills required as hiring of new workers is done to get things to normal it is getting difficult for them to provide them with suitable skills needed for some particular jobs and also the existing workforce is not trained enough to cope with the new normal of working online creditworthiness – it is defined as the extent to which a company considered suitable to receive financial credit often based on the reliability in the paying money in the past as businesses are dependent upon the line of credit and the supply chain if it gets hampered it will result in the loss of revenue as well as reputation for any business cash in hand is oxygen the small business which usually has at most month cash to run the business if the revenue stream dries up which in this tough time has to improve gradually to manage the optimal cash balance is the key to success in this tough time the optimal cash balance here defined as “the less of the amount of cash outflow in form rent employee salaries and raw material without postponing the payable as they are doing what banks have to do to the inflow from sale” cash conversion cycle it refers to how fast cash moves through the business in these times when a lot of businesses are switching to online platforms they should think of improving the cash cycle maybe by making changes in the sales cycle reducing inventory in hand and improving upon debtor's turnover ratio and cash collection period prioritize the products – the owner of the business should do an analysis of all the products and services it offers and ranks them on the basis of profitability they should focus more on the most profitable product and remove the least profitable product from their portfolio labour productivity – while it is difficult to manage the business with the current scenario if any business manages to do so they can have a huge advantage over others the productivity of the employee defined as the unit output produced by per employee while firing underperforming employees reduce the salary expense but variable performance based compensation will

66,some vendors fruit and vegetable sellers began venturing out after a few days without explicit permission and immediately faced police harassment after a few weeks the government eased restrictions and essential vendors were being permitted to vend due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks however the cost of doing business as well as the risk has gone up significantly with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city also with the lockdown still partially in place the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings due to the harsh summer heat perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have the state has recently announced a stimulus package of inr crore for nearly lakh vendors acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood the intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of inr for all vendors but this is not sufficient instead of credit the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit a cash grant as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly the vendors need income support to be able to restart work and if they are not able to do so how will they return the loan in the face of the ever changing crisis vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods to this end vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda livelihood promotion for all vendors including those selling non essential goods the impact of covid has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets for fresh food cooked food and essential household items and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads these markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same going forward vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities running water washing stations and toilets the authorities should work with town vending committees tvcs for the same provide direct support which is de linked from existing registration requirements as lockdown is lifted and vending resumes vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work the government stimulus package while a welcome step is insufficient in the nature of relief credit not direct cash transfer and eligibility only registered vendors are eligible which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country in addition government relief and support needs to be de linked from very rigid registration requirements as very few vendors have been registered in india in delhi out of roughly street vendors only about have some form of occupational identification if the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state then the government should also accept registration with a workers' organisation union as a proxy for government issued vending passes ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending the government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work additionally vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors especially cooked food vendors in ways to maintain hygiene while working taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits as mentioned earlier the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in delhi before the crisis and subsequent

67,the covid pandemic has grown into one of the most major and socially disruptive health crises in recent memory with growing worried about how the pandemic's catastrophic economic and social repercussions are affecting food systems at both the global and local levels given the importance of the retail food environment in establishing and sustaining healthy diets interruptions to specific aspects of it such as the availability of fresh vegetables could have a negative influence on population health which has already been noted as a source of worry despite the dominance of national and international supermarket chains warehouse clubs and supercenters in grocery retail vegetables are offered in a number of other food retail settings fresh vegetable vendors are typically smaller and more community oriented than other restaurant or retail food outlets and can include chain or independent grocery stores greengrocers storefront stands street carts and even makeshift platforms dedicated to the sale of fresh vegetables smaller community fresh vegetable vendors who may conduct business on the sides of major streets or on storefronts have played an integral role in the food environment in large urban centers such as new york city nyc particularly in ethnic enclaves despite the fact that fresh produce does not have a significantly higher nutritional value and fresh produce can also be purchased at these larger food retailers since the covid pandemic began many fresh fruit and vegetable vendors notably street carts selling fresh vegetables in cities across the united states including new york city have been forced to close owing to a combination of falling demand and fear of catching covid the importance of fresh vegetable vendors varies by neighborhood within cities furthermore these fresh vegetable vendors attract visitors and interborough shoppers from a variety of cultural backgrounds not only asian ones who are looking for things that are not available elsewhere in the city or for the same low prices these fresh vegetable vendors unlike larger well established grocery store vendors may not have the financial infrastructure to sustain the shifts in supply and demand produced by the covid epidemic consequently the danger of closure or modifications in services may be greater for these vendors in order to assess the impact of the covid pandemic on services offered by fresh vegetable vendors surveillance data from both before and after the pandemic's inception is required after a few days vegetable dealers began venturing out without explicit permission and were quickly harassed by police after a few weeks the government relaxed the limitations allowing vital traders to sell their wares due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks however the cost of doing business has increased dramatically as vendors no longer have access to wholesale markets and suppliers and they must spend more on travel expenditures owing to city imposed travel limitations furthermore with the partial lockdown still in place the number of buyers has decreased as have earnings perishable vegetables have a shorter shelf life in the summer heat thus vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have consider the situation of delhi at the starting of covid the state has launched an inr crore stimulus package for over lakh vendors realizing the serious consequences of their loss of livelihood the targeted relief for vendors is a credit facility that will provide all sellers with an initial working capital of inr but this will not be enough instead of credit the government should consider changing it into a direct income benefit such as a cash grant to help people start earning money on a regular basis the vendors require income support in order to resume work and how will they repay the loan if they are unable to do so vendor organizations must step forth in the face of the ever changing crises and lobby for vendors to be given the resources they need to continue their livelihoods vendor organizations could use the following as part of their advocacy agenda promotion of vendors' livelihoods particularly those selling non essential goods covid has had a particularly painful impact on informal labourers who have spent all of their savings and wages trying to feed themselves during the prolonged lockdown vendors must be permitted to restart peddling in order to survive and the government should take steps to reopen marketplaces and reintroduce vendors to the streets market reopening with social distance and hygiene in mind delhi features a variety of typically crowded markets including weekly markets for fresh food cooked meals and necessary household items and daily markets on the sides of highways these markets will need to resume considering the necessity for social separation and the government should issue recommendations in this regard in the future vending zones must be planned with social distancing in mind as well as adequate sanitary facilities running water washing stations and toilets for this the government should collaborate with town vending committees tvcs provide direct assistance that is not tied to existing registration requirements when the lockdown is lifted and vending starts vendors who have been at home for months will require direct income benefits in order to return to work while the government stimulus plan is a positive step it falls short in terms of assistance credit rather than direct cash transfer and eligibility only registered vendors are eligible which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country furthermore government assistance and support must be divorced from the country's strict registration requirements as only a few vendors have been registered in india only about of delhi's street sellers have any type of employment identity if the state requires occupational identity for any type of monetary grant or livelihood assistance the government should accept registration with a workers' organization union as a surrogate for government issued vending passes providing flowing water and soap sanitizers to street sellers at their place of business the government should take steps to provide street vendors with running water and soap sanitizers at their place of business additionally vendor organizations should collaborate with local food safety authorities to instruct vendors particularly those selling prepared foods on how to maintain hygiene while on the job taking measures to conduct a survey and register additional vendors for government assistance as previously stated the number of sellers with some sort of identity is a small percentage of the total number of vendors in delhi the town vending committees tvcs were expected to begin surveying and registering vendors before the crisis and ensuing lockout as we adjust to the new normal the survey and registration procedure should begin to guarantee that all vendors have access to social security benefits and financial assistance during this difficult time finally some fresh vegetable sellers may have shuttered for a period of time early in the epidemic only to reopen recently alternatively vendors may have launched soon after the in person checks were completed but still within the june july endpoint timeframe this is a drawback of the method in order to offer the most reliable covid pandemic monitoring data data must be collected in a short period of time blackcoffer insights priyanshu

68,as the coronavirus pandemic unfolds most industries face problems they had never imagined or prepared for the aviation and tourism industries face the highest stress as coronavirus spreads because not only are they a usually a leisure spending but also the nature of the disease directly conflicts with the industries' innate business models in this article we will look at the impact of covid pandemic on the tourism and aviation industries both from the demand side and the supply side the aviation and tourism industries has two major customers tourists and business travellers let us base this essay in the india and see what the reaction of the customer segments is expected to be like almost all tourists will avoid vacationing for the foreseeable future because of financial hardship an exceptionally large part of the world's working population has been affected financially because of the pandemic unemployment rates are soaring and the ones who do still have a job are facing pay cuts furloughs and deferment of salaries risk of contraction because the disease spreads via social contact it will only be safe to vacation if the destination is regularly sanitized and is not crowded inherently tourist destinations are not compliant with these regulations and even if the industry makes a change to being clean and introducing social distancing measures convincing risk averse tourists of to travel to these vacation spots will be difficult expansion of alternatives ways to relax as most people adapt to work from home environments the burnout rate is declining people are more relaxed in their own homes and very few people are eagerly looking for a getaway combined with this deterrent is the rise of alternative ways to relax more and more people are going out for walks doing yoga and finding new hobbies due to this increase for pursuit for happiness at home it might be likely that tourists will avoid traveling because they do not feel the urge to break free and move away for a holiday now let us look at different types of holiday revellers tourists can be foreigners or domestic tourists according to business insider “in almost million foreign tourists visited india — spending over ₹ billion during january to november period ” however because of the pandemic almost all this business has been lost due to the reasons stated above most foreigners will not prefer to travel those who do dare to venture out perhaps wooed by discounted deals to places which would have otherwise been out of their budgets will possibly be warded off by the one of the following factors poor quality of health care in india in the off chance that a tourist contracts covid they will probably be accustomed to a better healthcare system than the one india provides being a developing country india will find it hard to convince foreign tourists that our healthcare systems are up to the mark of their home countries densely populated regions around tourist destinations because most tourist destinations support a neighbouring economy the areas are often densely populated which leads to a higher risk of transmission of covid and the foreign tourists are cognizant of this fact moving our focus to domestic tourists we subdivide our population according to income levels below poverty line these people do not travel lower income families these people majorly only travel to religious places or to visit family thus they do not contribute to the aviation industry at all and generate very little revenue for the tourism industry as they prefer to stay in cheap lodges or at a relative's place middle income families they travel once in a year or two and tend to avoid airplanes revenue in the tourism industry is also limited from this subsection upper middle income families they vacation regularly often flying to near by holiday spots this section of our economy is severely hit by the coronavirus' financial hardships people have lost jobs and almost everyone has low liquidity being risk averse these people will probably save money and avoid spending on vacations for some time the loss of volumes from this sector will affect the aviation and tourism industries severely high income families this sector is relatively insulated from the financial hardships caused by coronavirus and is likely to spend on holidays if they are assured of the sanitization and social distancing in order to attract well paying customers the aviation and tourism industries will have to spend a considerable amount of money to become sanitation compliant which will push profit margins even lower most aviation and tourism activities made money not on individual margins but on collective volumes thus they are inherently incompatible with the concept of social distancing because of covid pandemic businesses have realized that more and more meetings can be handled over video calls thus the movement of business personnel will be restricted there will still be some representatives who will fly out to conduct business but the industry can expect a permanent drop in revenue from this sector moving over to the supply side the aviation and tourism industries face strong disruptions in their supply chain because the industry is a leisure expense manufacturing of many supporting equipment like the adventure sports gears and even parts of planes themselves has stopped because of the drop in demand it is going to be tough to get the supply chain back up again furthermore workers are afraid to show up to their jobs because of the high risk of contracting the virus due to exposure to multiple customers from different geographies let us now see some examples of how the industry has done through march and april airbnbs in america the bookings vanished in mid march property owners had bought or leased real estate to list on the app were severely affected the sharing economy like uber lyft and doordash had taken a hit but airbnb was worse off because their expenses include cleaning services interior design one time spend and property maintenance which are fixed costs thus because of the pandemic the revenue was gone but the costs exist they have people who depend on the owner's rental income which made the problem worse hosts usually decide cancellation policy but under extreme circumstances like this one the company decided to override all existing policies many of whom were not strict and gave full refund to the guests the company got billion loan and has helped out the owners financially by paying for cancelled bookings capping at k host they have helped some hosts by getting them eligible for small business loans and avoid eviction thankfully there are too few properties to cause a housing crisis but breakdown could cause strain on lenders and undermine property values all want to sell to avoid foreclosure or defaulting on loans airdna states that the listing split up for airbnb is list single property owners list properties hosts have properties some state governments in america have banned short term rentals this hurt the airbnb owners because people looking to quarantine outside their homes or near relatives could have generated revenues so what are hosts doing now many are discounting units and looking for long term tenants months many are planning to apply for a small business loan seek forbearance from banks find long term tenants independently of airbnb and sell property reluctance of workers to comeback to work america according to the wall street journal roughly half of all us workers stand to earn more from the coronavirus rather than their work pay cheques however it must be noted that some have not gotten their money due to bureaucratical issues this complicates reopening because workers do not want to come back and expose themselves to the virus and earn less but businesses want workers to come back so that their small business loans can be forgiven and business can reopen however money in the consumer's pockets means the economy expected to rebound quickly when businesses open about million americans are now on unemployment benefits majorly from restaurant hospitality and retail industries congress chose a flat amount of relief because it was really time consuming for payments to be calibrated to each worker's lost wages their federal payment corresponds to hours wage but states follow hours most workers do not want to sit at home and are anxious to get back to work but right now staying at home is the smartest financial decision for their families workers should be ineligible for unemployment benefits if a job is made available to them but owners are reluctant to report workers to authorities and sever relationships with employees they may need more later in the year when tourism demand is expected to pick up without income support low wage workers would likely seek out other jobs including side hustles and gig work which could expose them and their households to the virus thus according to the government it was important to give such a large stimulus to the economy coronavirus on planes studies of sars suggested that people sitting close to infectious persons were at large risk combined with that in long journeys passengers may take off masks thus the risks of transmission are large and airlines need to focus on figuring out how to prevent transmission in planes currently the airlines plan on using self cleaning material long lasting disinfectant touchless lavatories uv light as a disinfectant antimicrobial coating for frequently touched surfaces and cleaning between flights however even after these efforts only of people are flying compared to last year same time as of th may aviation and tourism industries have the curse of being a luxury expense and thus as the coronavirus pandemic spread the entire industry jolted to a halt they are one of the hardest hit sectors and have to adapt to a new normal wherein the revenue levels are unlikely to match to pre covid levels and margins have also reduced however in with a bleak future this industry is here to stay because people have to travel and eventually they will vacation as well coronavirus has become a “survival of the fittest” test for this industry and the stakeholders will come out of this disaster with strong business processes blackcoffer

70,the covid pandemic has reshaped the fundamental fabric of our world initiating in china in late december the virus has since then spread to every corner of the world infecting millions in its wake countries around the world have responded by shutting down their economies and advocating lockdowns of varying degrees india has arguably had one of the most stringent lockdowns of all countries restricting the movement of people goods and effectively transforming every city into a ghost town due to such stringent restrictions on movement the economy has received a fatal blow the virus arrived in india at a time when the country was already in strife dealing with a slowing gdp growth rate and an ever increasing fiscal deficit the lockdown has simply exacerbated the economic predicament pushing multiple businesses and industries to a moribund state other countries have also faced a similar predicament particularly in the us and europe both being hotspots for virus transmission however upon taking a closer look at the global economy there seems to have been an upward mobilization in some of the sectors in the it domain these sectors seem to have exorbitantly increased their scale of operations and have overall reaped hefty profits so what is it that differentiates these areas from the rest and what can we learn from them a path to victory if we look at the evolving it ites industry around the world the domains that have flourished in this strenuous time all have had one key characteristic in common flexibility these sectors have adopted a more flexible approach to dealing with the lockdown be it flexible working procedures or adopting newer more advanced ways of working in line with the requirements of our time they have not shied away from changing the rules of the game let us look at some of these areas within the tech domain that have been successful in conquering the lockdown social media lockdowns around the globe have confined people inside their homes with nothing much to do of significance as a result social networking sites have reported a gigantic rise in user engagement over the lockdown period reportedly there has been close to a rise in daily text transmissions across messaging platforms such as facebook instagram and whatsapp in the hardest hit economies twitter has reported a increase in its user base as compared to last year the data makes it evident that social media platforms are here to reap the benefits of a lockdown situation video consumption sites such as youtube instagram and tiktok are in line to reap massive profits it is no wonder that viewership on these platforms has increased manifolds due to lockdowns these platforms serve to be a distraction from the tragedies of the real world in such stressing times and offer an easy escape be it rumors regarding the cure for covid gossips or rap battles these platforms provide viewers with their much needed dose of distractions as they say “ignorance is bliss” data mining enterprises the lockdown has proven to be a miracle for data mining companies with such an exorbitant increase in the number of hours spent online globally these firms now have access to significantly larger sets of data than they otherwise could ever have widespread implementation of data mining has been seen recently with most countries opting for government regulated surveillance applications that monitor your movement at all times moreover these applications have access to your personal information as well as medical records countries such as south korea and singapore are at the helm of relying on such means to control the outbreak although noble such initiatives do raise a red flag with regards to user privacy the public has been provided with very little information about how these applications operate and what goes on behind the scenes this creates an atmosphere of obscurity that is frankly harmful to the premise of a democracy cloud computing cloud computing has been on the rise for the last couple of years however the pandemic has made it the de facto king in terms of computational services with an increasing reliance on remote working the ability to store data in one secure location has turned out to be critical the cloud computing services such as amazon web services microsoft azure and google cloud have reaped hefty profits in the process the emerging landscape in the tech world seems to suggest an upward trend in reliability on these services as far as large scale data storage and computing is concerned e commerce social distancing measures have made it practically impossible for people to physically go shopping for groceries and other necessities moreover a majority of retail outlets in cities have reported negligible engagement for the fear of transmission of the virus e commerce sites have been the real winners in this predicament of global consumerism with high standards of hygiene and at home delivery these sites have provided an easy alternative to retail stores other similar businesses include food delivery apps and grocery sites that are also flourishing today amidst the pandemic recent weeks have made it evident that e commerce websites are well on their way to abolish traditional shopping methods ott platforms online streaming platforms consist of a relatively newer approach to entertainment having only been in existence for the past couple of years they had already however established a name for themselves before the lockdowns sites such as netflix and amazon prime had been dominating a chunk of the market share and competing heavily with movie theatres for new releases for a while now now with the lockdown practically deleting theatres and cable tv from the collective psyche of the entertainment industry they are well on their way to becoming the platform of choice as far as entertainment for the masses is concerned this has already become evident with zee india reporting a whopping increase in subscriptions and a increase in the time spent on their site within the first couple of weeks of the lockdown itself another such platform mubi reported a rise in its viewership in india only a week after lockdown commenced these facts are a clear indication of the exponential growth that is in store for these platforms which is unlikely to change anytime soon video conferencing platforms the idea of working from home is all set to be the new norm in our professional culture which requires an easy and effective way to communicate over the internet not just audio or text but video conferencing is the need today hence it is understandable why multiple video conferencing services are set to reap massive profits off of the new norm arguably the most popular of these zoom has reported a increase in its price share since the beginning of another such platform known as the microsoft teams collaboration suite operated by microsoft has reported a whopping million increase in its user base in the very first week of the lockdown in the us this data is only likely to have an upwards trajectory considering the increasing pace at which industries are going online the indian picture the indian it landscape has also undergone massive cultural changes according to rajesh gopinathan chief executive officer and managing director of tata consultancy services ltd the “work from home” model of operations is here to stay he also claimed that the firms only requires a workforce to be physically present for any project at any of the locations tata consultancy services which is one of the major players in the indian it landscape has shifted almost of its workforce into a remote borderless workspace model and other smaller firms have followed suit what it tells us is that we are headed in a direction we are unlikely to return from remote working appears to be the modern protocol for operations and is unlikely to change anytime soon however a major challenge often overlooked in such circumstances is that of an adaptable culture the culture of workspaces has to be drastically altered and members of the workforce have to dive headfirst into the new way of doing business this is critical to ensure that the industry can combat the pandemic and recover gloriously a duality unlike any other the lockdown has presented us with a stark contrast unlike any other we have witnessed where on the one hand the industries mentioned above seem to be exhibiting exponential growth with their people thriving and having every possible resource at their disposal the unorganized sector and the msmes micro small and medium enterprises seem to be at the crux of death the sector that consists of people for whom having guidelines to work from home is irrelevant as that was never really an option people with no fixed wages or social security to fall back on during this time of crisis as a result of the lockdown several of these msmes have effectively become inoperable and have resorted to massive layoffs just to survive this has resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs with nowhere to go to for

people have been initiating treks back to their villages what is witnessed is a massive influx of migrant workers flooding the highways walking weeks to find shelter and food truck drivers responsible for delivering goods have also resigned stating that they have no means to eat because of the closure of every food joint on the highways both these realities present a stark contrast and expose a

71,introduction a video game is any software program that can be played on a computing device such as a personal computer gaming console or mobile device video games have been in existence since the early s and have become increasingly popular spanning different mobile smartphones tablets and stationary computer or console platforms advances particularly in mobile devices have given birth to social networks and group gaming although the nature of gaming does not require physical stamina and therefore is not limited by factors such as age gender or fitness it is most popular with adolescents in the world health organization who classified gaming disorder in their international classification of diseases icd the icd is a list of diseases and medical conditions that aids health professionals in making diagnoses and treatment plans for patients having various disorders it should be noted that the inclusion of gaming disorder in the icd by who has generated vigorous and sometimes contentious debate and discussion within the medical and mental health community although recognized as an area of clinical interest the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm published by the american psychiatric association suggests that more clinical research is required before gaming disorder is formally considered as a psychiatric disorder similarly the who notes the inclusion of gaming disorder in icd to encourage more research into excessive gaming behavior including its prevention and treatment what is online gaming disorder who draft th revision of the icd denotes the disorder as a pattern of “digital gaming” or “video gaming” behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming activity increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities and the continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences online gaming disorder has the same similarities with internet gaming disorder igd which is a condition that the american psychiatric association apa noted in dsm as an area in need of additional study the apa does not currently recognize igd as an official condition for gaming disorder to be diagnosed the who criteria require that the behavioral pattern of the gamer must be of sufficient severity that major and noticeable impairment and deterioration in personal family social educational occupational or other important areas of functioning is present for a minimum of months signs and symptoms of online gaming disorder according to the who definition a person with online gaming disorder will demonstrate the following characteristics for at least months problems controlling control their gaming habits seeing gaming as more important over other necessities and daily activities or work continuing to engage in gaming even after its negative health and social problems has been identified or are evident further research shows that gaming disorders can also be linked to anxiety depression obesity sleeping disorders and stress people who remain physically inactive for long periods because of gaming may also be at higher risk of obesity sleep disorders and other health related issues according to who health consequences of video online gaming video game related health problems can cause continuous strain injuries skin disorders and other health issues other problems according to shoja et al include a condition that could be termed video game provoked seizures in patients with pre existing epilepsy the following health consequences of video gaming have been reported vision issues video game playing is associated with eye problems extensive and fixed staring at a video game screen causes eyestrain because the cornea pupil and iris are not biologically equipped for chronic heavy viewing of digital images from electronic devices the visual system strain from frequent video game use over extended periods may result in headaches dizziness and in some cases nausea and vomiting interestingly there is some research that shows that gamers have an enhancement of spatial distribution of attention compared with non gamers this somewhat predictable practice effect occurs with both peripheral and central visual attention for sufferers of amblyopia dimness or blurring of the eyesight due to a fault in transmission from the eye to the brain video games may be helpful musculoskeletal problems persistent gamers may also suffer from musculoskeletal problems a survey of children indicated increased physical complaints associated with video game playing such complaints range from pain in the hands and wrists to back and neck furthermore a case report involving a nine year old teenager referenced playstation thumb playstation thumb is characterized by numbness and a blister is caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid and persistent gameplay using dermoscopy dermatologists discovered hemorrhages and onycholysis the loosening or separation of a fingernail in a patient who presented with hyperkeratosis also tendon injuries tendinosis of the hands and wrists from tendon overuse is another health problem associated with video game playing furthermore another case report in the new england journal of medicine reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal from people who play wii video games this condition has been termed perhaps sarcastically a wii fracture there are also postural problems associated with the persistent playing of video games although ergonomic measures including chair to monitor position could potentially improve postural problems associated with video game playing obesity and overweight playing video games consistently has been associated with obesity this is maybe related to the lack of physical activity in players alternatively it could be that those who are less physically fit because of obesity gravitate towards less physically demanding activities such as gaming in either case several studies have linked television and video games and increased body mass index bmi it has been estimated that children in the united states spend of their waking hours watching either television or playing video games furthermore children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity if video games are replacing physical activities and young people do not participate in physical recreation or see playing of video games as a form of recreation this may be part of the link between times spent while playing video games and a rise in bmi in teenagers evidence for this potential link gains some support from a german study reporting that boys who spend no more than hours per day engaged in television watching or playing video games were less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than hours engaged in the same activity in a study an association between video game activity and an increase of mostly junk food intake was reported specifically single video game sessions caused an increase in food intake regardless of appetite it has also been suggested that active video game play using two popular gaming platforms has the opposite effect other researchers found no evidence that more active video games would result in a beneficial outcome although the study did demonstrate an increase in the amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video games seizures epileptic health concerns that video games may cause epileptic seizures started in the early s the first medically documented case of a video game induced seizure was reported in in a story in the popular press sun newspaper reported that a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game similar but less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world ultimately motivating video game console manufacturers to include that epilepsy warnings in the instruction manuals for their gaming products in it was reported that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to epilepsy and advised that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying feet or more away from the tv set and wearing sunglasses while playing video games this is clearly an area in need of additional research prevention and treatment of online gaming disorder the cost benefit value of prevention versus treatment of addiction disorders has been known for many years it is important and beneficial to make use of several types of strategies in combating gaming addictiveness or disorder effective strategies include educating gamers about gaming behaviors and consequences on their mental health treatment geared towards helping the gamer to control his her urge for video games recognizing and dealing with disturbing thoughts and learning how to cope without video games intrapersonal and interpersonal counseling to help gamers to explore their identity build self esteem and enhance their emotional intelligence outside the fictional world of gaming and learning communication and assertiveness skills needed in social interactions family involvement including counseling and discussion family and other relationships and developing new lifestyles the latter is particularly important and to paraphrase the well known mantra of alcoholics anonymous it is all about people places and things to prevent the

73,finding ways to make using the internet easier is something most modern consumers are passionate about since the rise of ai infused technology like amazon's alexa or apple's siri voice search has grown increasingly popular in fact nearly percent of people all over the world use voice search at least once a day as this technology grows more popular and complex with each passing day business owners are starting to take notice of voice search capitalizing on this trend is only possible when optimizing the content on your website for voice search are you trying to make your website more voice search friendly if so check out the following tips accuracy of voice search in the past if you wanted relevant answers from a voice recognition technology well—good luck with that but today machine learning systems can compete with people in terms of accuracy google's voice recognition google is now able to understand human language with percent accuracy these improvements mean that while you can trust good voice systems to match customers with the right products services or information with increasing degrees of nuance leading businesses already have set customer expectations for delivery thanks to machine learning algorithms that can detect speech and respond with meaningful results the interest in voice is only going to grow because voice search systems are at a point where they actually can perform reliably and meet customer expectations just as well if not better than traditional query options customer trust in them is growing of to year olds talk to automated voice systems at least once a day voice shopping is expected to reach billion by —up from billion in global smart speaker sales expected to exceed billion by of people who do not have a voice assistant would like to buy one of smart speaker owners would like to get information about deals sales and promotions yet only of businesses are properly optimized for voice search what is with the disconnect in other words business leaders are at an ideal intersection where reliable systems are available and there are still many customers who have not been reached or who might want more out of the systems they currently use bringing those systems and customers together will help companies avoid being left behind people are after convenience and all types of information when people use voice search they do not just want to locate a great pair of shoes or a tv people want all kinds of other information such as your store hours how to connect to support specialists and when you are having your next sale this is partly why some experts have predicted a “totally different internet” within the next five to years one where voice activated chatbots have all but replaced the e commerce channels we are used to using shoppers are also after general tips that can take some of the friction out of everyday life—think life hacks and how tos in fact words like “how ” “what ” “best ” and “easy” are among the top voice search queries this means that when it comes to online marketing you probably need to change your entire optimization approach taking elements like grammar and semantics the structure of your site and structured data markup that influences google's ability to find your content of course optimizing from the start not as an afterthought is ideal how voice become part of customer brand interactions voice search can be used on both desktop and mobile searches we can see that customers want different types of information from voice systems they also can use it at many points in the customer journey for example about half of shoppers use voice to research products even “near me” searches results are mostly done by customers customers also use voice to add items to shopping lists track packages make a purchase give a rating or review contact support reorder something these statistics show you should think beyond just having customers find you or your products voice search and commands can take your buyers from start to finish so give your customers as much convenience and satisfaction as possible by integrating voice options into more types of interactions voice is often just the starting point a survey showed that once a consumer makes a local voice search their next most common action is to call the business customers also are highly likely to visit company websites show up at the company's location and do more research into that business or additional businesses and respectively so in short while voice services can allow a customer to complete many steps without human interaction you should not see it as a total substitute many people are going to take further steps after the initial search and they still will want to hear a human voice respond back once in a while they are going to have more questions and they are willing to physically connect with you and what you offer do not drop the ball in other areas like making your site aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate having enough staff ready to chat listing an accurate contact number or keeping your store well stocked voice search already is shifting the way customers engage with brands but there is still time for companies of any size to get involved with voice systems in ways that can benefit both the customer and the business's bottom line the next step is to find voice search solutions however as with other technologies these are not necessarily one size fits all meaning it is critical to shop around and be specific about your goals if you can customize and update your options in a scalable way they will be even more effective for your business,46,finding ways make internet easier modern consumers passionate rise ai infused technology amazon's alexa

74,the pandemic has shaken the world in the way one had hardly imagined the impact of it on jobs and services is going to be long lasting and it will be the foundation stone of revolution in these sectors with the work from home and social distancing norms is altering the way of work the way we interact what work we will do how the work will be done and whatnot to just give an example in the middle of the first lockdown fmcg major hindustan unilever hul went ahead with its merger it took place online entirely yes it took place online who could have ever imagined the merger can take place online change is inevitable but some changes are temporary and some are permanent the pandemic is bringing changes that are going to be permanent in fact these changes were due for a long time and we are coming at a slow pace what the pandemic has done is it has become the catalyst for these changes and raised the ante for change so what exactly the changes will be let us look at them one by one the first change is going to be the extensive use of digital communication from now onwards the zoom jio meet google meet and some derivatives like these are going to be the forever meeting rooms where the important discussions will be held this may be bad news for the employees who are older than years they would not have pictured themselves doing such transformation at this part of life experts believe that the new normal in the offices are going to be hierarchy less the older employees would have to work with the younger ones there would be no geographical boundaries and where the communication and software adaptability among employees is going to be crucial the symbol of power will be less visible and the decentralization of power in the office will be prominent there will be more egalitarianism in companies the corporates will think much more about office space rather than expending too much on physical infrastructure the online infrastructure will always be in their hindsight the impact would be more prudent in small and mid sized businesses the physical offices itself might disappear from such businesses but it is not going to be easy for companies the security and confidentiality of the authentic information going out of the offices' building are going to be the largest concern in the new normal world there would be no surprise if a lot of start ups will bloom in the near future providing software for security for the data and information of the companies also travel is going to be reduced so the major component of ctc where the companies fooling the employees must find the other way the second change is going to be struck down on employees already many of the companies and start ups are reducing the workforce it is expected that new normal offices would work with an workforce of that of the current workforce automation is on the verge due to safety reasons the companies are going to be more and more leaned towards automation with a minimal touch of human possible this might result in a loss of jobs in some sectors but it will also create new jobs in the automation sector it was evident from before pandemic too but now the velocity for the same would be increased in the new normal tech enabled world the job which would be at stake dominantly would be managers' managers the it firms have started firing the vice presidents and assistant vice presidents who draw hefty salaries but do not really drive the business in the designation less set up in the near future accelerated by pandemic they automatically become redundant for the first time the employees might be given jobs that would require more than the standard jobs also when the workforce in the company would be less in the company the employees might be given the option of working for extra time or working on the weekends and would be incentivized for the same rather than employing more staff and paying them full salary it is a win win situation for both employees and companies employees can earn more than what they usually earn and will get to learn new which would be out of their primary domain the companies would be able to keep their costs low through this the assessment of employees might change too rather than going for an annual performance review the employees might be evaluated based on the tasks they perform creativity and innovation are going to be swords for the employees in the new normal world rather than designations in the office the other change might be in the services sector the services like which involves maximum human touch will be the one which will be affected most adversely the safety concerns and confidence of people over the system are going to be the issue for at least the next few years it also opens the opportunity for something very new the products which could replace the need for visiting such services centers are going to create a boom in the market according to mckinsey the sales for such products are multiplying rapidly there are speculations that the economies will tend to become minimalist economies let us dig deep into this minimalist economies are the economies where people tend to refrain from purchasing luxurious items and focuses on purchasing necessities more and more well this is the position we are in right now during the pandemic people are expensing only necessary items like groceries and the demand for luxurious items is way below average but it would be hard to stay the same as this the minimalist economy will result in the deterioration of the economy in the short term it is true that in the minimalist economy the demand might be low but it would be wrong to assume the demand will be zero the high quality products will gather the attention of the purchasers it is evident from past experiences that the economy always finds its way to come back from the mode of minimalist economy though this time may take some time it will surely return on track but every trouble comes with an opportunity this is the time for the companies to act now and grab the opportunities the pandemic has brought with him but for that companies are required to follow plans formulate strategies to suit their needs and pay more attention to the innovation the companies must form plans for the five stages from here these stages are rs resolve resilience return reimagination and reform resolve in the resolve phase companies need to formulate a nerve center to combat corvid itself the tendency of the company should not be like that they will return only after everything becomes normal in most parts of the country permission is granted to the companies for their operations if they wait for normalcy then bankruptcy might catch them before the normalcy resilience the resilience phase includes maintaining liquidity addressing solvency and grow for sustainability all businesses should know when their cash crunch is coming addressing these cash crunches will be crucial for the companies businesses must take aggressive options to remain solvent for example the businesses might have cash in their hand but might be poor in operational efficiency then it requires the attention of the company organizations solving issues of liquidity and solvency will be in a better position to grow with sustainability return in the third phase of return the companies will have to plan for the time when everything will be back on track given the possibility of subsequent waves of coronavirus the companies need new ways of working to prevent identify report and contain future flareups many industries will face this problem of returning staying prepared for resurgence scenarios should include a multi scenario modeling exercise reverting to non covid care will require extensive planning and market testing reimagine the phase of reimagining will include the learnings from the pandemic a small virus and the whole economy at the toss the businesses will have to introspect them and must look for advancements in technologies such that this kind of pandemic in the future will not disturb their efficiency too much the pandemic has taught us that the decision which took weeks and months in the normal world can be accelerated and can be taken in some days this should become a permanent feature cross organizational collaboration has become much easier this should stay in the long run reform the last phase is the reform in this phase the companies should look at their bottlenecks and try to fix them also the companies will have to reconsider their relationship with their customers the confidence in their brands they must regain it there are three ways to shift work talent and skills to where and when they are needed most thereby building the organizational resilience and agility necessary to navigate uncertain times and rebound with strength when the economy recovers make work portable in this dismal situation it is more important than ever most of the staff should be in the critical tasks the tasks could be like the customer complaints redressal we know that the customers are the ones who make the businesses successful thus retaining their confidence is the utmost priority the organizations can convert some of the staff to address the queries and concerns of customers the organizations require to create virtual offices there should not be the geographical boundaries within the organization the employees from all over the world from the organization should come together and take the organization back to pre corvid state by breaking out of rigid job constraints the right talent and work can be matched to solve evolving business challenges in real time accelerate automation this was happening before the pandemic too but accelerating it with pace has now become the need of the hour the perception that automation is a job killer is totally wrong and in fact it is the mandatory capability to deal with the crisis organizations can increase automation in call centers this will reduce the response time share employees in cross industry exchanges temporarily moving employees from some industries like airlines restaurants hospitality can be moved to those organizations which have maximum work at this time like healthcare and logistics to conclude the companies should understand “lives come

75,social media is such a staple of our evolving digital culture that it is almost hard to imagine a time without updates likes comments and shares people are more concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes thus it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence the phrase “out of sight out of mind” has never been so apt than in today's time social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content it is why we call it “social” media social media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read click on and share your message in practicality it is not about a one off communication but more about the construction of a long term relationship with your target customers hence when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative to consider the positive actions of users as a reaction of any brand's engagement tactics a fundamental customer journey can be envisaged in the form of customer funnel the touchpoints available at every step can be shown as awareness consideration decision purchase post purchase touchpoints word of mouth social media regular advertisements on the customer journey map congruence with perceived and offered benefits cost benefit analysis value proposition place and time utility loyalty towards product switching costs retail on portal conversion levers customer schemes dissonance purchase complexity to understand the reach of social media by the use of numbers most popular social networks worldwide as of july ranked by number of active users in millions how many retweets on twitter how many reactions to the post on facebook how many likes on instagram how many shares on linked in this seems to be the new age resume thus a good question or mystery for any brand is how to measure their social media engagement as with most online actions it is often difficult to measure offline benefits more often than not the online campaigns do not drive any conversions on the same day week but a user may see those posts and become more familiar with the brand that familiarity later on might result in him choosing that brand over an unknown competitor social media engagement as a result helps businesses in developing their brand's personality improves visibility and becomes its voice customers exhibit dynamic behavior based on the type of product it could range from picking and variety seeking to high involvement processes comprising extensive information search top of the mind recall rules due to this purchasing behavior implies that targeted advertising and marketing is extremely important no one engagement strategy can be applied across brands each brand's strategy must differ based on what the brand is trying to sell its target customers and the beliefs of the brand some of the key aspects of marketing strategy that we have influenced as vital cogs in the digital marketing wheel are influencer marketing influencer marketing involves a brand collaborating with an online influencer to market one of its products or services here the audience does not care much about your brand but the opinions of the influencers an influencer as being someone who has the power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of their knowledge position authority or relationship with their audience a following in a distinct niche with whom they regularly engage the size of the following depends on the size of their topic of the niche saw chanel being named as the most influential luxury brand on social media since then it has continued to grow and diversify its portfolio while providing constant engagement to its plethora of followers especially on instagram cross channel marketing cross channel marketing or multi channel marketing is the practice of using multiple channels to reach an audience because not everyone uses every single platform it is a good idea to have a presence on a few and share some of the same content across the different networks what makes a difference in this marketing strategy is the choice of platforms apart from using basics like facebook instagram and twitter a clever use of spotify youtube or igtv to showcase the brand can make a real difference the luxury vehicle brand land rover's cross channel marketing includes the google display network homepage masthead and masthead in lightbox ads on youtube and visibility through mobile search and google the brand's digital campaign included four different influencers who created visual content for their blogs by taking trips to places like glacier national park and the appalachian mountains and land rover's microsite their cross channel efforts resulted in million impressions from youtube and a increase in search ad ctr further results found that online leads from its digital channel efforts now account for of the brand's total sales informative the content created on social media must add some value addition to the customers the brand must constantly keep informing the customers about their existing products new products achievements of the brands or even casual content there should be “wow i did not know this” factor only then will they become regular followers of the brand an example of this would be a cosmetic brand posting make up tutorials fenty beauty is one such prime example which has built up to m followers within just days of its launch eventually garnering close to m followers with rihanna being one of their icons involving customers engaging them “customer is king” is a known concept it is the foundation of traditional marketing so while we shift to social platforms brands must not forget them understanding their needs addressing them inviting them to respond and take part in the brand's online activities while keeping it interesting and entertaining for the customer is the key founder and ceo of glossier emily weiss described the brand as “the first socially driven beauty brand ” glossier was certainly the pioneer in the term ‘instagram brands' – using the platform not only to build awareness but also to have focused conversation with the customer glossier often crowdsources product development asking its instagram followers what they would like to see next dynamic the content creation must be dynamic and suitable for the current season festival or event that is happening people must be able to relate to the posts and they must get excited after seeing it starbucks does a marvelous job when it comes to being dynamic their one off recipes and continuous hype around seasonal events and related drinks have won them a silver ipa effectiveness award for its social strategy in the launch of its now iconic ‘unicorn frappuccino' spurred on the trend of brands deliberately creating ‘instagrammable' food and drink as a result there are now posts using the hashtag pumpkinspicelatte product focussed now of course the real motive behind any marketing activity is to eventually sell the product so it becomes extremely important to not lose the essence of the product while marketing in simple terms the content or strategy must not leave the customer confused about what the brand actually does or what it is trying to sell to support the product centric statement oreo is the best example oreo's social media strategy has never diverged from its original formula completely product focused and yet always creative the brand continuously finds ways to put its cookies center stage the ‘daily twist' campaign to mark its th birthday saw the brand turn its oreo cookie into something of cultural relevance for days including elvis presley a baseball and a rainbow flag in support of pride visuals “a picture is worth words” this adage has never been more apt than in the age of social media this is why visuals are so important in any marketing strategy you can talk about a product all day but until you are able to put it in front of someone is eyes it is not going to have nearly the same

76,petty entrepreneurs like streetside food stalls form an essential part of an economy that plays a significant role in balancing the development of a nation's economy the importance of street food vendors not only helps in increasing the country's per capita income but also helps to make a living for the unemployed in society with a limited investment most of them are the sole breadwinners for their families so with the covid wreaking havoc the uncertainty of the lockdown policies increased the concern of people over hygiene and the lack of investment to upgrade their businesses to provide better hygiene facilities that can take away food from their mouths various states have provided relief packages and support but in a country as populous as ours it has hardly been appropriately implemented delhi for instance recently announced a rupee million stimulus package to nearly rupees recognizing the severe consequences of the loss of livelihoods the seller's intended remedy is a credit loan that provides all sellers with an initial working capital of rs but this is not enough instead of loans the government should consider converting them directly into income benefits cash subsidies to secure a livelihood in order to initiate income generating activities on a regular basis sellers need income support to get back to work and if they cannot they will never be able to repay the loan amount in an ever changing crisis organizations need to take a step forward and ensure that providers are provided with the resources they need to make a living pandemics have had a vast economic impact on every sector but the most vulnerable sectors such as street vendors suffer the most decreased income can affect most necessities such as payments to family and yourself due to a lack of fixed salaries stalls cannot quit their jobs if possible it might be only a few days unlike regular employees for them the risk of infection is far less frightening than hunger unlike many of the businesses most of these food vendors lack the infrastructure to go online and sell products through platforms like swiggy or zomato “regret not going digital before ” says dilip das a street side food stall owner at sector v kolkata dilip das used to run a small streetside food stall that provided meals to all the employees around the area which is filled with multinational companies it was a booming business till the arrival of covid then with the lockdown arriving almost all the companies opted for work from home policies dilip tried to start deliveries but with a lack of support and fear of infection that business ended before it even started citing similar reasons swapan mondal who runs a south indian food stall at park street said that he did know how to operate a smartphone and since sales were good he did not care about learning either but with the implementation of lockdown which took place within hours people like swapan barely had time to cope with the changes furthermore the covid pandemic made people realize how important trains are in our life with most of the train network suspended the entire supply chain was disrupted hundreds of quintals of food products rotted away awaiting the logistical issues to fix many businesses could not afford to run without proper supplies as well to handle such issues vendors organizations may consider the following solutions promotion of livelihood for all vendors including sellers of non essential goods the impact of covid was extremely severe for informal workers who ran out of capital and income and to try to feed themselves during this long embargo sellers need to be able to resume sales in order to survive and governments need to take steps to reopen the market and bring sellers back to the business reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene india has different types of traditionally crowded markets even weekly markets fresh food cooked food and essentials and daily roadside markets these markets have to reopen with the need for social distance in mind and the government needs to publish guidelines for that in the future sales areas will also need to be designed with social distance and the need for adequate sanitation running water wash areas toilets in mind authorities need to work with the town bending commission tvc provision of direct support that is devoid of existing registration requirements once the restrictions are lifted and the impact of covid is somewhat manageable sellers who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to help them to return to work the government initiative is a welcome move but not in terms of the type of bailout and eligibility is enough in addition there are very few registered providers in india so government relief and support must be separated from the very strict registration requirements in delhi alone of the approximately street vendors only approximately have some sort of professional id if all types of cash grants or livelihood support standards relate to job identification by the state the government must also accept registration with workers' organizations unions on behalf of government issued sales badges ensuring social distancing and proper sanitation and hygiene at sites of businesses the government and municipal corporations need to take the initiative and running water and soap sanitizers need to be provided for street vendors at their place of work moreover the streetside food vendors should work with food safety authorities in the country to train themselves in different ways to maintain hygiene whilst working taking steps to spread awareness of different government initiatives and reliefs many small businessmen and food vendors do not even know their rights and the benefits they can claim if they did many still have no idea about how to claim them proper awareness camps need to be set up to help these small time food vendors to know how they can get assistance and help from the government and return back to the business when covid was an unknown word these shopkeepers and vendors brought the taste to our mouth

77,the coronavirus also known as covid is not only a global public health emergency but also a source of significant regional and increasingly global economic disruption this impacts the energy and climate world in many ways the economic downturn puts pressure on global oil prices leading the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to consider further cuts to production it hurts the demand for natural gas during a time of extremely low prices it changes the economic energy and climate policymaking environment in china one of the most consequential energy consumers and sources of greenhouse gas emissions and it has temporarily disrupted supply chains throughout the energy industry including renewable energy at a time when supply chain connections with china were being revaluated due to ongoing tariff and trade disputes how consequential or transformative any of these changes are for the energy sector or for climate efforts will depend upon the ultimate trajectory of the virus outbreak itself — sarah ladislaw senior vice president and director energy security and climate change program the energy sector has already felt the impacts of the coronavirus the outbreak has contributed to a dampened demand for oil resulting in plummeting oil prices and production declines as we move forward then the energy sector expects to face two headwinds managing the issues of the health emergency all sectors face and simultaneously coping with a low oil price scenario lower demand and the need to shore up revenue and manage debt obligations impact of covid on indian energy markets in india distribution utilities have a lower tariff for domestic and agricultural consumers sometimes even below the average cost of supply as compared to that for commercial and industrial consumers table provides the electricity tariff rates in delhi for selected consumer categories to highlight these differences thus for several distribution companies the lower tariff paying consumers are cross subsidized by commercial and industrial consumers category fixed charge ₹ kva month energy charge ₹ kwh industrial single point delivery supply for group housing societies agriculture table electricity tariff schedule for fy – delhi electricity regulatory commission derc the covid lockdown has led to shut down of all but essential commercial activities across the country approximately billion citizens are obliged to remain within the confines of their homes and in many cases only allowed to work from home consequently the electricity demand from industrial and commercial customers has reduced significantly while the residential demand is expected to have increased according to the power system operation corporation of india posoco the energy met on march th – which can be considered as a business as usual scenario – was mu as compared to mu on march rd a day of voluntary curfew it further reduced to a range between mu between march th to march st this trend is illustrated in the below figure figure daily energy met mu thus firstly a key risk from the covid pandemic for the already struggling distribution companies in india arises from the loss of revenues due to the reduction of demand from the commercial and industrial customers as well as the inability to cover the cross subsidies provided to the lower tariff paying consumer secondly the utilities would also have to account for the expense to comply with any ‘must buy' commitments that they have with generators with long term power purchase agreements the true and full extent of this risk would only be known once a quantitative analysis is conducted when this crisis situation is contained thirdly at an operational level distribution companies would have to account for deviation in demand and supply patterns at a temporal and locational level finally during this period critical infrastructure such as electricity networks would have to be run with minimum employees covid impact on the power market as seen in figure the trade on the wholesale power market comprises just percent of the total electricity transactions however the transactions through the power exchanges have grown over the last decade the indian energy exchange iex has seen a growth from mu in fy to in fy figure share of market segments in total electricity generation source cerc until now the trade in the wholesale market is in four market segments day ahead market term ahead market renewable energy certificates energy saving certificates recently the central electricity regulatory commission cerc finalized the regulations for implementing real time markets this half hourly market will enable the intra day trade of electricity allowing adjustment of generation and consumption profile during the day before the covid pandemic it was announced by cerc that the real time market would be operational from april st however the starting date has now been delayed by two months to june st according to media reports due to the covid pandemic some required trials could not be completed this delay in the real time market implementation is likely to have a serious adverse impact on the indian power market another impact of the covid pandemic on the power markets is in terms of the market dynamic it can be observed that there is a dip in the clearing volume and the market clearing price which coincides with the gradually increasing shutdown measures taken by the government as a response to covid see figure thus the reduction in demand due to the lockdown is reflected in the volumes traded on the electricity market and the clearing price another point of reference is the price and clearing volume in on march nd the day of voluntary lockdown the clearing volume was gwh and the clearing price was ₹ mwh in comparison on the same day in the clearing volume was gwh and the clearing price was ₹ mwh from the start of the lockdown from march nd to april st the average clearing volume was gwh compared to gwh in during the same period similarly the average market clearing price was ₹ mwh in as compared to ₹ mwh in for the same period views of the shareholders in india the lockdown has resulted in a shutdown of the industrial and commercial establishments and the stoppage of passenger railway services this has adversely impacted the all india electricity demand given that these segments constitute about of the all india electricity demand a statement issued by the rating firm said further these segments account for an even greater percentage of the discoms sales revenues given that they are the subsidizing segments this apart with the focus of state governments being on healthcare and relief measures the likelihood of subsidy support to the discoms getting deferred cannot be ruled out it added icra ratings group head and senior vice president – corporate ratings sabyasachi majumdar said “the lockdown imposed by the government is likely to adversely impact the all india electricity demand with demand expected to decline by about on a year on year basis during the period of lockdown this would in turn adversely impact the revenues and cash collections for distribution utilities in the near term especially given the consumption decline from the high tariff paying industrial and commercial consumers and likely delays in cash collections from other consumer segments the revenue deficit for the discoms is estimated to be about rs billion per month on an all india basis this would in turn adversely impact the liquidity profile of the discoms increase their subsidy requirement and lead to delays in payments to the power generation and transmission companies ” the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies and requested state governments to issue similar directions to state electricity regulators the power generation companies are already suffering delays in payments by discoms across the majority of states with payment due of more than rs crore as of november at all india level as per the data on praapti portal with covid lockdown accentuating the delays in payments the availability of adequate liquidity buffer in the form of debt service reserve and undrawn working capital limits remains important from a credit perspective however it said that relief measures such as a moratorium on debt servicing over a month period as notified by reserve bank of india and expected moderation in the interest rate cycle would be a source of comfort in the near term the timely approval of the moratorium by the boards of the banks and financial institutions remains crucial the revenues for power generation companies having long term power purchase agreements ppas with the state distribution utilities discoms will be protected by the provision for capacity charges linked to plant availability in case of thermal and large hydropower projects and “must run” status in case of nuclear and renewable power projects average monthly thermal plf would further dip to against in the corresponding period of the previous year due to a considerable drop in demand and consequently power generation companies especially those without any long term ppas would be adversely impacted given the weakening of the power tariffs in the short term power exchange market said icra ratings sector head vice president girishkumarkadam the under construction renewable power projects as well as epc and manufacturing companies in the solar segment are likely to face execution delays because of disruption in the supply chain in india and labor availability following the lockdown given the import dependency on china for sourcing pv modules the execution timelines for the ongoing solar projects are likely to be affected by delays in the delivery of pv modules following the outbreak of covid in china this delay in turn would increase the pre operative expenses and the overall project cost which in turn would have an impact on the expected returns in this context the mnre has notified that time extension can be provided for all renewable energy projects which are impacted by the supply chain disruption due to the covid outbreak under the force majeure clause “given the execution headwinds amid covid affecting q of fy and assuming the normalcy thereafter the capacity addition in the wind and solar segments together is likely

routine life who recognized it as a pandemic on march as of april worldwide around lakh people have been infected and more than lakh people have succumbed to covid though a vaccine has not been developed yet the spread of coronavirus can be stopped by washing hands frequently covering one's mouth while coughing and practicing social distancing from other people countries across the world are using lockdowns as an effective way to stop the spread kb of rna has brought the world down to its knees one third of the global population has been in lockdown schools colleges businesses services

emphasized more than ever the importance of future proofing business for growth and resilience the hospitality industry includes various services like lodging food and beverage events tourism transportation theme parks etc before covid – prevailed we all know that this industry was in much demand and was also one of the major sources of the rising economy during vacation and festive periods these were always full of people worldwide as of now due to the havoc created and ongoing lockdown they are bearing many losses and is one of the main reason for the decreasing economy have you ever thought of hotels been converted into hospitals quarantine centers and isolation centers yes my dear people amidst this outbreak many of the hospitality industry properties be it tiny or enormous have come forward to help the nation fight this life menacing virus taj hotel in mumbai is attentively aware of its responsibility towards the community and has opened its doors for the major frontline workers i e medical fraternities to stay at their place while they combat the spread of this treacherous virus also many of the government bodies have been transformed to provide shelter to the homeless recently in vadodara – gujarat the building which was built for the employees aiming to work for the major mumbai ahmedabad bullet train project has been come forward to make it an isolation center for doctors and nurses “railways – the lifeline of citizens ” as railways have started their service years ago from that period they are being considered as the lifeline of citizens in many metropolitan cities today at the time of the global pandemic railways have not backed off from the position of the lifeline yes my dear friends you have heard it right railway coaches in india have been turning into the hospital and isolation centers marking their presence by helping the government to increase the number of isolation beds also many special parcel express trains are running in the entire nation to fulfill the needs of people by transporting essential commodities and goods hospitality has been one of the most innovative industries in the crisis so far connections have been rapidly formed to donate food and beverages to local charities from various hotels many of the hospitality bodies are standing in solidarity with the communities affected by this threatening disease by lighting their windows in the shape of a heart seen in hotels across the world with this outbreak there is a sharp drop in tourists worldwide as the aviation railways and public transport buses have come to a standstill due to severe government restrictions today it is clear that hospitality industries must be prepared for various situations like a pandemic climate change etc as of now they are facing devastating and disastrous covid impact on its various sectors the debt being the normal capital intensive component has to be serviced by payment of interest on debt and repayment of debt hotels being labor intensive have lots of fixed costs such as wage bills besides paying government levies minimum load charges etc the earlier indian hospitality industry was on average witnessing to of occupancy till the end of february the first few days of march were fine once things started accelerating the occupancy has gone down to a severe minimum also as soon as the pandemic ends by god's grace the hospitality industry will still face some loss as the tourists will be much lesser in the beginning months as soon as the crisis gets over the hospitality industry will have a very crucial role to play in rehabilitating lives within their local communities millions of people will be unemployed leaving them at high risk of poverty and exploitation as the industry starts to recover hospitality will be one of the sources to increase employment to the needy ones taking the poverty level to a minimum within india after the crisis over people should travel to the less known and highly economically affected destinations to help the hospitality industry overcome the loss they bore due to covid hence the hospitality industry suffered and is suffering a lot due to this pandemic and despite that it is also helping the nation to win against this dangerous disease thus covid impact on hospitality “let's be grateful to all the frontline workers saving the entire nation

79,as a race we are not ready for any kind of crisis we have fire extinguishers in buildings but barely any knowledge of how to use it we convince ourselves that we are prepared but in the face of adversity we stand dumbfounded and give the simplest excuse that of being in ‘unprecedented times' the same thing has happened with the coronavirus crisis if we look back we can see that this crisis was not avoidable there was a lot we could have done but because we underestimated it so much the situation has now blown out of proportion and cost us thousands of lives millions of jobs and a massive hit to the world economy we may be in a unique condition but there is still a lot that we can apply from past experiences and previous calamities first let us look at this in a reflective mode what are the things we could have done to avoid this crisis in the first place controlling the origin of a virus is difficult but preventing it from spreading is not one of the biggest contributors to this unforgiving crisis is the lack of communication or even worse the propagation of fake news take india for example clear communication about the virus was only initiated after a few cases had been identified we were aware of the hazards of this virus since before and should have acted sooner the spread of accurate and timely information is a must if we had spread awareness earlier we could have controlled the number of cases better like new zealand and ireland have done secondly in a situation of crisis the first thing to spread is fake news it is imperative that the government social media agencies and people themselves act more responsibly since there is no accurate and transparent information a lot of uncertainty exists in the society this impacts the confidence of consumers and investors in the market which in turn leads to an economic slowdown past experiences with financial breakdowns and recessions have shown us that retain market trust can only occur with transparency and accuracy of information organisations should have acted earlier and communicated more effectively with their employees moreover we must also understand that specific sectors take the hardest hit during lockdowns as we have witnessed in earlier lockdowns curfews national emergencies and pandemics the first segment of society to take a hit is the daily wagers and labourers not only do the prices of goods increase but their income also takes a decline in such a crisis in such situations they cannot even afford basic amenities india witnessed a mass exodus recently with thousands of people trying to return to their villages on foot this only leads to more chaos and a decline in containment of the disease the government should have accounted for such factors before announcing a lockdown with a four hour notice they could have made better arrangements for food and water in the metro cities itself or giving them safer means to travel home this is something that they can still include in their relief programs government intervention is a must right now this can be done in two ways first is to create more employment opportunities governments used this strategy in the sars and ebola virus emergency health water sanitation and hygiene are the most services in the times of health emergencies intense investment for these services and infrastructure can provide immediate jobs secondly if governments use fiscal and monetary policy to fuel demand and maintain current living standards it can decrease the propensity of a huge fall in economic growth a fiscal stimulus by the government can make all the difference having better avenues for cash transfers easier loans and more exchange will automatically help a fall in the growth rate is unavoidable as lots of sectors have no choice but to pause all work however industries that can provide high returns even now must be encouraged for example it sector health food and agriculture etc moreover governments and businesses should use the most important tool in their hand the internet even in the times of physical social distancing we are still connected to people across the world and are socialising at our normal rates governments should use these mediums to maintain public spirit communicate policy strategies and inform people businesses should use these means to continue working and maintain employee morale to have balanced crisis management and to prevent panic in the masses social dialogue and engagement at every level is imperative use these mediums to educate people about the importance of social distancing hygiene and steps to be followed all diseases are different and the scientific approach to tackle them varies however with most epidemics and pandemics some common steps can be followed our past experience with fast spreading diseases has shown that the easiest and most effective way to curb it is social distancing countries have taken impressive steps to ensure social distancing and must keep this up for even a few weeks after curbing the disease maintaining sanitary habits and hygiene can protect us from infections and increase our immunity while governments and medical agencies look for ways to tackle the virus at a macro level we must continue to follow all measures on an individual level too we must also pay a lot of attention to mental and physical well being now in the past when economies took a hit due to the recession or calamities the first thing to break was people's self esteem suicide rates amount of domestic abuse and cases of depression increased manifold we have to take effort and ensure that we try and live as much of a balanced life as possible we should stay connected to our friends and not be ashamed of reaching out to others for help social distancing is not easy and can take a toll on many lots of special helplines have been set up for the same and people must use them if needed governments have also given code words for victims of domestic abuse to report crimes in countries like france and spain we must remember to stay mentally healthy and calm during a crisis as that is the most important thing i do not believe that every crisis is the same of course there are a lot of unique things about the coronavirus pandemic that we had not expected to ever see even though these are different times there are still lots of things we can apply from our past experiences we cannot find a cure for the virus but we can find ways to maintain the economy our mental peace and prevent the spread of the virus the past has a lot to offer if we ponder we must learn to understand the mistakes of the past and better them in the future our past experiences with the different crises have taught us that fiscal stimuli work maintaining employee morale is important and that social engagement is imperative if we use these tools efficiently we can ensure that people only have to fight the virus and not worry about the multitude of repercussions that come with it blackcoffer insights vani milind agarwal shri ram college of commerce srcc,72,race ready kind crisis fire extinguishers buildings barely knowledge convince

80,covid an unprecedented pandemic for us but a “can be” possibility for great leaders such as bill gates came into action since the rising of the year the corollary of this pandemic is so prodigious that the analysis by the un department of economic and social affairs desa stated that the covid pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade which in turn could shrink the global economy by up to percent in a reversal from the previous forecast of percent growth more than million americans filed unemployment claims and the economic downturn is expected to be the worst recession since the great depression as stated by the imf india is facing its biggest crisis in decades with a three week lockdown initially but extending further in a nation of billion people likely to result in an economic recession millions of job losses and possible starvation among the poor it can be said that economic contagion is now spreading as fast as the disease itself on the contrary nature has pressed the reset button the environment is having a noticeable benefit from this scenario water is getting clearer the air is turning breathable and various such news and pictures can be easily heard and seen on newspapers telly and social media platforms on day to day basis but this is the storyline of the present what about the future are the predictions made by financial institutions and thought leaders going to be true or something unexpected is going to happen that will make us think of our human capabilities again after this storm of covid it would not be a surprise to see how digitally every business will grow to provide better digital infrastructure and customer experience along with advancement in technology which we are lacking in this present scenario the touch screens that we are using already will find its vast applications and would be seen in most of the places including hotels hostels and shopping malls all those processes which are interdependent will take an agile turn resulting in better productivity of goods having a systematic backup giving a better experience to the consumer even in hard situations the major focus would be making contactless systems hence artificial intelligence and machine learning will become the most rapid and in demand fields not only this but the medical infrastructure and services will also take a boost in the race of developing the systems to handle any situation afterward the human to machine interaction will increase facilitating fast production delivery and surveillance inculcating many more in each and every area the covid will leave its mark may it be retail sector or may it be the banking sector making them modify or fully change their architectures even the existing systems would be gifted with some modifications ensuring them to work in a hard environment even with or without human intervention the companies will rethink their policies shaping themselves accordingly to manage the resources ensuring safety agility and work to be a top priority the work from home idea will also provide a base for bigger companies ensuring to develop a better infrastructure for their resources and probably giving birth to a new concept of work culture various existing industries related to either delivery or travel may adopt the new idea of collaboration with other industries which will result in more options for consumers on their old routine apps new businesses will root out from the existing ventures resulting in head to head competition in the business world but turning into a brownie point for consumer experience and bandwidth of choices start up culture will go hand in hand and expected to take a stupendous growth in the race of providing us a legitimate opportunity to use and feel the real digital world the various innovations will now take a pace in each field and maybe we will hear some new jargons related to tech in upcoming years since the global economy has fumbled countries will now try to take a different turn to vamoose out of this phase they will try to make new connections by nurturing a give and take relationship and several business relationships would take an unexpected move making the position of several countries sliding up and down on indexes even rival countries may join their hands in this hard time rather than being dismissed totally under predator countries it would be surprising to see how these scenarios will be handled by the emperor of minds and how their opponents are going to take it as an agenda for the next elections unfortunately the nature that is at its best will start to face the ill effects after the chart of development and economy will take a pace for exponential growth it is unfortunate that the inverse relationship between economic growth and environmental destruction exists since carbon emission increases with economic development as shown by the graph below whenever recession took place the carbon emission decreases along with other harmful gases turning out as a gift for nature but doom for the financial markets but there is a possibility that several start ups now emerge with the idea of environment conservation collaborating with ngos innovating and using the best of their capability to reduce the ill effect from the present origin point in the culmination we can say this pandemic is like “blessing in disguise ” producing a massive impact not only on macro but also on micro economy the novel virus not only brought some unexpected results but also uncovered some of our loopholes and unlatched new opportunities for growth forcing us to define ourselves in several new spheres quite a while ago we all were chit chatting about the digital era how this is benefiting us covid revealed making us realize this was just the beginning of digital era and a lot is needed to happen in future it is obvious that not only the indian economy but the global economy is facing and going to face the aftereffects however similar to a virus the economy will also rise from deep grounds to a green candlestick with individual collaboration the businesses will soon rise again people will get back to their jobs vendors will start getting profits and everything will fall into its places but now a megalithic competitive environment will rise which will grow till decades until nature

why the bri has become controversial and has caused a backlash in many countries a shift away from roads and bridges bri expenditure up to stood at billion wb estimate about two thirds of spending on

83,perhaps the virtual illusion has become today's “new reality” inquisitive about the conclusion let us attempt to vindicate as the outline story unfolds itself ever since the concept of gaming floated back in the s a new dimension was put before human beings intangible in nature and paradoxically engulfed us since then it laid an impact on multiple generations in different ways the last decade witnessed a boom in this industry with the advancement of technologies in virtual and augmented reality the gaming world has become an integral part of our day to day experiences with the intent of being regarded as a leisure activity it has now percolated over various strata and has managed to gather the attention of teenagers and adolescents on a comprehensive scale as we explored the fabric of our engineering batch mates we came across this peculiar guy holding excellent academics with accolades of his names seemed to be a nerd at a glance and street smart by nature concomitance happened to be the reason for experiencing the lifestyle of other personalities that included sam as well sam was not only fascinated by the games but used to spend tirelessly hours and hours in front of the white screen engrossed completely leaving the track of time as our academics advanced the intensity of involvement in gaming grew deeper and steadily it turned into addiction in no time we realized the gravity as we were exposed to his change of behavior and shift of priorities due to his unprecedented absence during our lectures and practical he was modestly reluctant to share about his whereabouts with his peers the situation turned grim when he was not able to cope up with the subjects and was socially disturbed while interacting he was compelled towards the fantasy world and was trapped in the vicious cycle of a never ending backlog of games as time progressed his performance turned from bad to worse he was struggling it was clear as ice that he had something hidden behind that visage as sophomores we were also involved in gaming but soon realized that it does more harm than good a close cluster of friends decided to lend a helping hand to sam and as they learned about him the ground beneath their feet slipped away and froze their brain he had completely lost the circadian rhythm of his sleep ran into financial losses aggression draped him his relations were tarnished due to the habitual routine and signs of depression were visible on the upfront poker was the tartar that he had caught the game of cards as most of us would perceive it rather proved to be the fulcrum of sam's near future in the quest of pleasure through online games he entered the tunnel of gambling at a very tender age ignoring the risks involved in terms of financial verticals he was suffering from internet gaming disorder igd his condition deteriorated as days passed by apparently from a healthy individual to a drained skinny one it took a toll on his physical health mental disturbance sucked him and he grew insensitive towards his academics the psychological negative consequences were due to the combination of online gaming and gambling platforms during that phase the peer group gaming group gained more influence than parental control days arrived when he ran short of money and went ahead to ask his friends in college for the funds since a large amount of money is involved in gambling a situation exacerbated when sam had his ethical values on the line and breached his boundaries to satisfy his hunger of gaming and leaped towards illegal means to fund his gambling the practical project was a crucial part of our engineering curriculum under which a team of four members was to be established and is expected to remain intact for a year sam was by no means in anyone's good books no one in the batch was ready to risk with sam even though he possessed a brilliant acumen he was abandoned we were three friends already and were scouting for the fourth with mutual consensus we decided to go ahead with sam initially we worked together and collaboration seemed to be perfect unfortunately he was not able to clear his backlog exams and had to drop out at present he plays poker on a professional level keeping aside his engineering career and battling with his conscience that we may not be aware of earlier generations used to spend their time or rather invest their time into activities building up their passion in some cases they pushed their cognition to such an extreme and contributed to a level that humanity as a whole is in depth to date can we imagine our present without the existence of sir edison sir newton sir tesla sir einstein and many more that were engrossed in their domain and served the necessary impetus for our generation no one knows that sam could have been our generation scientist had not he chose that path not everyone is sam but perhaps we could miss our einstein or tesla maybe our newton is waiting for the new upgraded version of the game instead of sitting under the tree our mendeleev might be involved in arcade games feels so numb millions of teenagers are involved in online gaming platforms

sanitizing hands regularly wearing masks and social distancing as viable methods for prevention against this virus what is social distancing and how is it helpful social distancing means staying away from other people so to limit human interaction various governments all over the world chose life before the economy and ordered complete lockdown in their countries all schools colleges offices factories public places etc were shutdown from immediate effect as of th june covid confirmed cases worldwide are with deaths and recovered the usa did not impose lockdown in the early stages due to

like depletion of the ozone layer climate change soil erosion air pollution water pollution soil pollution acid rain noise pollution loss of biodiversity and many more are a result of our selfish and

85,epidemics in general have both direct and indirect costs associated with direct and indirect measures adopted to counter control the epidemic which generally have both short run and long run economic and social consequences the coronavirus covid outbreak globally lead a significant setback to the entire globe the first case was detected on th december in china the world health organization who prepared the first diagnostic kit on th january as the global coronavirus or covid pandemic continues to take hold every economy is feeling it is effect with a high degree of uncertainty taking a toll in all the manufacturing sectors supply chain management is an important area with many opportunities for our community to contribute in various forms according to the data produced by supply management's report on business show that pmi purchasing manager's index has declined in the month of february mainly there has been a huge contraction in the petroleum transportation and textile industries although there has been a fall in the inventory but is expected to grow due to supply chain disruptions leading to inefficiencies in material conversion and continued advanced stocking to protect production schedules a analysis by trading platform forex claimed that heavily of all companies had already reported supply chain disruptions with more than believing that at some point they would experience impacts as a result of covid disruptions the effective shutdown of industrial activity i e china ground zero for the virus presented particularly difficult problems for manufacturing firms worldwide imported goods invested by investors set a significant setback several experiments were carried out by different governments across the globe to restrict the spread of this pandemic boris johnson introduced the herd immunity plan in the united kingdom which was a failure followed by a mitigate model which india also tried initially to stop the spread of the covid virus the last and the ultimate model that most of the countries are applying is the hammer and the dance model i e the lockdown model which is estimated to bring down the caseload by the lockdown model basically means buying time to prepare the vaccine to kill the virus however the lockdown has certain critical economic consequences which add to the burden of global distress this can be explained using the standard macroeconomic keynesian model the lockdown and the spread of the disease have a direct negative shock on aggregate consumption levels and exports this leads to a contraction in aggregate demand which leads to a fall in the market rate of interest and aggregate equilibrium output the secondary effect on the commodity market is via investment demand function which can either increase owing to a fall in the market rate of interest or fall owing to the contraction in aggregate demand clearly the contraction of the aggregate demand side generates an economic slowdown on the other hand restriction of workers gathering in the workplace owing to lockdown hurts the production in those sectors which need the presence of physical workers note that software or financial service producing sectors are exempted from such negative supply shock at least in the short run to medium run since those works could be easily carried out based on “work from home” anthem however reverse migration of workers is an indication of a sharp cut down in production activities this aggregate supply shock leads to the situation of stagflation in recent announcements by the reserve bank of india rbi to ease liquidity in the system may prove to be counterproductive provided the aggregate supply shock since the escalation of demand specifically for non traded products without an adequate increase in production supply would only result in inflation in other words supply side management must go hand in hand with demand side policies even if policies are undertaken at the national level by the government however conditions may not improve much due to shocks in the external sector through trade in commodities most imports are banned which will increase the economic cost of production of import substitutes within the domestic territory based on the theory of comparative advantage in a ricardian sense at the same time exports are hurt due to lower demand from the developed economies this shows that unemployment and inflation are inevitable in the near future corona virus has mainly affected raw material export driven countries with the covid virus in the backdrop there will be a decline in new orders production and employment with ease in supplier deliveries as demand will be less with a mild decline in the inventories there has been a huge revenue impact long stretches of empty supermarket shelves and shortage of essential commodities are only the visible impacts to consumers of the global chain disruption caused by the covid pandemic the uncertainties ahead swing between extremes as the shortages worsen before they get resolved prices of many commodities could go up for consumers even if laws exist against price gouging at the same time we should keep in mind that constrained supplies could cause a decline in demand which in turn may end up weakening prices risk management process is not robust enough to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic the seemingly relentless forces of globalization and technology with coronavirus in the backdrop will present us with new supply chain challenges and opportunities for further progress in the near future there is a glimmer of good news as countries globally haven taken preventive measures but the recovery may be fragile the crisis due to the global pandemic is likely to be more serious for developing economies compared to the global financial crisis of this is due to the fact that the global financial crisis leads to lower demand for exports from the developing economies by the developed nations which further lead to contraction of export based industries and other sectors in the developing nations due to inter sectoral backward and forward linkage effect however the burden of retrenchments in the formal sector was absorbed in the informal sector in the present situation the problem of vanishing informal sector is evident since informal sector workers are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease due to the absence of non regulatory authority and out of direct government control moreover lockdown lead to massive close down of this informal units thus the informal sector in this present set up is vanishing due to which the shock absorption capacity of developing economy like india is becoming weaker the global economy is drowning towards deep cycles of economic depression and the aftershocks seem to be long lasting the only way of this global shock seems to be international policy coordination in line with the needs of the domestic economies blackcoffer insights anusil das st xavier s university,53,epidemics general direct indirect costs direct indirect measures adopted counter control epidemic generally short run long run

86,covid has bought the world to its knees with businesses being shut travel being banned schools and colleges being closed we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction though situations are improving now and the lockdowns are being lifted it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally we have been reading articles regarding the impact of covid on the economy education mental health and every other possible aspect but one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of covid on office space and co working industries well it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now but the covid period has not ended this means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space the same will be the condition in co working industries wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof however these problems are quite obvious though people have not thought about them much but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters but it also extends to metal space or for that fact space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country just the way a car needs repair after an accident our country will also need repair after the control of this virus but unlike a car our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support needless to say the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason but the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees while some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary people tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition the problem does not arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other but instead it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others and in today's world where people keep money at the top of their priority list comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary this may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better but however will bring huge losses in the long run the fact is employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss's eyes moreover since there will be comparisons among the employees it might happen that the ‘employee of the month' ends up being hated by all other employees in the company another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they do not this might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office in fact employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices wherein employees will compete for attention and resources which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning and all this will happen because of only one thing lack of office mental space i e space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long lasting impact of covid is the co working industry and offices this is because there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure as well the rent will remain the same because of this employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used however the number of resources will be the same and so there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same if the above two situations happen to occur at the same time

89,as business close to help prevent transmission of covid financial concerns and job losses are one of the first human impacts of the virus not knowing how this pandemic will play out also affects our economic physical and mental well being despite this fear businesses and communities in many regions have shown a more altruistic response in the face of crisis – actions which could help countries preparing for covid covid is in decline in china there are now more new cases every day in europe than there were in china at the epidemic's peak and italy has surpassed it as the country with the most deaths from the virus it took days to reach the first confirmed cases worldwide days for this to increase to and just four to reach confirmed cases – a figure now exceeded the human consequences in recent weeks we have seen the significant economic impact of the coronavirus on financial markets and vulnerable industries such as manufacturing tourism hospitality and travel travel and tourism account for of the global gdp and million jobs are at risk worldwide global tourism travel and hospitality companies closing down affects smes globally this in turn affects many people typically the least well paid and those self employed or working in informal environments in the gig economy or in part time work with zero hours contracts some governments have announced economic measures to safeguard jobs guarantee wages and support the self employed but there is a lack of clarity in many countries about how these measures will be implemented and how people will manage a loss of income in the short term behind these statistics lie the human costs of the pandemic from the deaths of friends and family to the physical effects of infection and the mental trauma and fear faced by almost everyone not knowing how this pandemic will play out affects our economic physical and mental well being against a backdrop of a world that for many is increasingly anxious unhappy and lonely fear of the unknown can often lead to feelings of panic for example when people feel they are being denied life saving protection or treatment or that they may run out of necessities which can lead to panic buying psychological stress is often related to a sense of a lack of control in the face of uncertainty in all cases lack of information or the wrong information either provided inadvertently or maliciously can amplify the effects there is a huge amount of misleading information circulating online about covid from fake medical information to speculation about government responses people are susceptible to social media posts from an apparently trustworthy source often referred to as an “uncle with a masters” post possibly amplified and spread by “copypasta” posts which share information by copying and pasting and make each new post look like an original source as opposed to posts that are “liked” or “shared” or “retweeted” sadly criminals and hackers are also exploiting this situation and there has been a significant rise in coronavirus themed malicious websites with more than new coronavirus related domains registered since january hackers are selling malware and hacking tools through covid discount codes on the darknet many of which are aimed at accessing corporate data from home workers' laptops which may not be as secure as outside an office environment social distancing and lockdowns have also prompted altruistic behaviors in part because of the sense that “we're all in this together” many people report being bored or concerned about putting on weight others have discovered a slower pace of life and by not going out and socializing have found more time for family others and even their pets the downside of self isolation or social lockdown are symptoms of traumatic stress confusion and anger all of which are exacerbated by fear of infection having limited access to supplies of necessities inadequate information or the experience of economic loss or stigma this stress and anxiety can lead to increased alcohol consumption as well as an increase in domestic and family violence in jingzhou a town near wuhan in hubei province reports of domestic violence during the lockdown in february were more than triple the number reported in february essential actions from the business community health measures must be the first priority for governments business and society it is important for businesses to show solidarity and work together to protect staff local communities and customers as well as keeping supply chains manufacturing and logistics working according to research “my employer” is more trusted than the government or media daily updates on a company website with input from scientists and experts are recommended to counter politicized messages in the media and from governments this is particularly true for large companies that have the capacity to do this messages about what businesses are doing for their employees and in their communities is also important some companies are helping schoolchildren from vulnerable families who can no longer get a school meal others are providing public health messages about effective handwashing even ceos can show they are working from home and self isolating while still being effective in their leadership following who advice there is a need for the business community to move from general support to specific actions and focus on countries' access to critical supplies including a “community package of critical items” a list of items that all countries need of these items are either not available locally or available stocks are too limited these missing items fall into four categories hygiene chlorine hth alcohol based hand rub liquid soap diagnostics lab screening tests lab confirmation tests enzymes rna extraction kits ppe gowns scrubs aprons sterile gloves protective goggles face shields masks n or ffp case management equipment oxygen concentrators oxygen delivery systems mechanical ventilators the call for action is for more money to work with manufacturers to create capacity and to organize purchasing so there is guaranteed access especially for poorer countries with less resilient public health systems the concept is to create a global security stockpile of supplies and equipment an effort that needs emergency financing access to and increases in manufacturing capacity access to national and supplier stockpiles warehouses and distribution capacity blackcoffer insights jatin tiwari gurukul kangri

all wanted breaks we used t crib and cry about not getting time for family and friends not having time for self this coronavirus outbreak had taught each one of us that how important it is to be thankful for everything we have in our lives while sitting i just realize that how lucky we are that we do not have to go out amidst this crisis to work and earn bread how sorry i'm for each the daily wage workers who have no other way but to go out the second lesson is that we all can survive without fast food we all are chefs and have made a lot of appealing and tasty dishes without spending a

of them is the awareness about the cleanliness the term cleanliness that took modi ji about years to teach people about swachh bharat abhiyan a single case of the virus has taught everyone the importance of cleanliness and hygiene corona virus crisis has taught how the humans at halt can lead the nature to work at itself nature has its own mysteries and how what the humans have done to its beings is done to them they are too imprisoned like the animals they have had imprisoned for years away from their homelands this crisis has gaped the differences between the communities and brought the humans together we can see a wave of excitement in everyone when modi ji gives his tasks still remember how my colony just rang up with the sound of bells and plates and claps and how beautiful it looked with the balconies lit up with diyas and candles it looked like diwali in the month of april but diwali with no pollution and noise this crisis has made everyone of us thankful to the medical and nursing staff who had been working × hours away from their families so that we can stay safe with our families it has just made me realize that we never know if we will see the sun tomorrow if we will see the people we love if we can talk to them again so let us not hold grudges and let the go and flow corona virus has united all the humanity against a cause to defeat a virus this virus has

hospitality industry embodies various sectors like transportation traveling airlines hotels and lodges etc hotels and traveling are also a major part of the tourism industry the tourism and hospitality industries may appear somewhat similar but they have their subtle distinctions tourism mainly involves traveling and services to those who are away from home the hospitality industry involves businesses and services that are concerned with leisure and enjoyment and mainly run on customer experience and satisfaction their customers may also be local inhabitants along with tourists the hospitality industry can be majorly divided into accommodations travelling and food and drinks accommodations include hotels resorts hostels motels etc the best of the hotels and resorts that were basking at their peeks now have no option but to lay off their employees many hotels are down to zero occupancies and have led to an immense loss for the hotel establishments the same is the case for resorts hostels motels etc that provide accommodations since there are no occupants there is no money inflow which is leading to the layoffs of employees as the owners are not able to provide paychecks anymore businesses in the accommodation sector that have just started are finding it difficult to cope up with this situation various governments have extended small business bridge loans to cope up with this situation the accommodations sector has no other way to cope with this situation but to wait for the situation to improve so that they can improve their business traveling restrictions are imposed by various governments to avoid the spreading of coronavirus travel agencies car rentals tour operators flights and airlines have been hit quite severely by covid due to the fear of spreading coronavirus people have limited their public outings or have stopped stepping out altogether unless to shop for daily essentials coronavirus impact on travel that ban lays out restrictions on who can travel from where to where many international and domestic flights have been suspended to tackle the coronavirus crisis havoc is created across the aviation industry the months from march to may are said to be the busiest times of the year for the tours and travel industry but people are reluctant to travel in the fear of catching coronavirus or getting stuck abroad if the governments announce restrictions thereby overstaying their visas that can imply their future travels abroad airlines and tourism agencies have stopped marketing and advertising as it would be irresponsible and does not make sense during this crisis to cope up with this situation airlines like virgin atlantic and american airlines have started deploying passenger flights to carry cargo while various airlines have laid off commercial travel has dropped tremendously also there is a recent drop in jet fuel prices it is being estimated that many airlines are going to go bankrupt if this situation persists apart from airlines the cruise industry and travel agencies also take a toll this year they are facing cancellations of bookings and some new travel agencies are at a risk of closing down rendering all their employees either losing their jobs or going on unpaid leaves in this time of crisis it is predicted that once the pandemic is over or the situation is under control the travel and tour industry can take about months to return to normalcy however this outbreak may affect the entire tourism industry's future many foods and drinks services fall under the hospitality industry as they offer people services that provide them leisure time their customers not only include tourists but locals passerby's etc these mainly include restaurants tea and coffee shops bars and pubs catering etc catering is provided at places mainly where there is a social gathering to deliver food and drinks services where it is not provided or not according to the organizer's preference due to this pandemic many countries are in lockdown and even those that are not in lockdown are not allowed to hold public gatherings as a safety precaution due to the avoidance of public gatherings and events to maintain social distancing catering services are halted for now restaurants tea and coffee shops pubs and bars have all closed down not only for the safety of their customers but also keeping in mind the safety of their employees and workers however a few restaurants that offer food delivery are still working by taking all the necessary health and sanitation precautions to prevent the spreading of coronavirus the number of such restaurants seems to be declining with the increasing cases of covid as the customers are becoming more and more afraid and cautious about the situation though quick service food deliveries can cope better than the full service restaurants during this crisis because of this unprecedented crisis all these industries that are being affected are hoping for government support to make it through such tough times without some financial support or help from the government or other institutions it will be difficult for various establishments to survive through this crisis it is being indicated that the world will face the worst recession since the great depression during this pandemic with so many people losing their jobs especially those working in

94,the hospitality sector in india has witnessed unprecedented deceleration this year in the wake of the covid pandemic the indian hotel sector has been hit hard tussling with significantly low demand with very few future bookings since the outbreak of covid companies have been canceling interviews at the top hotel management colleges in india the overall hiring sentiment in the country is witnessing a negative impact in the short term with percent of interviews getting postponed especially in the hospitality services sector following the slowdown across industries triggered by the coronavirus pandemic even the students who were aspiring for a career in the hospitality industry are on the verge of full swing currently with the imposition of section there are barely any bookings being made for the future and the current ones all stand canceled in this scenario there is limited scope for quick revival it is proud to see that this sector shows its maturity level in working together showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can for example by making their venue available for hospital beds and hospital employees the situation we are in also brings new business models and opportunities in defining for instance new delivery concepts human capital sharing platforms initiatives in promoting the “staycation or holiday concept” and the use of the less productive time to work on activities that were normally pushed forward like asset counts security plans defining standard operating procedures social media plans etc what has caused the panic this may seem obvious but it is worth looking at this a bit closer the main reason there was such widespread panic was that the government announced its advice to avoid public meeting places like restaurants bars and pubs without simultaneously announcing a complete ban or a plan to support the businesses whose revenue streams they would just denied many of these businesses operate on low margins and very fragile cash flow already so the prospect of survival for an indefinite period of time without income seemed very bleak indeed this has taken a mental toll on already stressed business owners and their worried staff facts figures – coronavirus effect on the hospitality the impact of the novel coronavirus on india's hospitality sector jobs is nothing short of severe while most economists expect things to rebound in the latter half of the year uncertainty still lurks a sheer job trauma is staring at the hospitality industry in the near future this is as the chances of losing a job are at high risk furthermore the entry level has postponed the hiring for the near future let us check here some of the facts concerning the drop in the various hotel occupancy sectors the country's daily hotel occupancy dropped to during march according to preliminary data from str department of revenue ministry of finance government of india due to covid concerns and limitations that have intensified in india along with a steep downward trend in occupancy the average daily rate adr and revenue per available room revpar have also dropped significantly in india adr which has dropped year over year by around or more for eight consecutive days went as low as inr on march revpar attained its least absolute level inr on march in india both luxury and budget hotels are running at just percent of occupancy levels as thousands of people have canceled their trips this may further worsen in the times to come at least till the end of this year for instance airbnb announced its guests could cancel their reservations for a full refund the overall revenue of the indian hotel sector is set to decline by anywhere between us billion to us billion reflecting an erosion of to compared to last year besides the actual business loss the hotel owners will also incur losses due to fixed operating expenses debt repayments interest payments and several other compliances required to be undertaken as part of the sector with hospitality and travel sectors among the worst affected by covid oyo's entire executive leadership cxos team has taken a voluntary pay cut starting at with many opting for a supplementary untapped amount and some going up to to enable constructing the runway for the company ritesh agarwal the founder group ceo oyo hotels homes has decided to forego of his salary for the rest of the year in the wake of the novel coronavirus crisis proposed action plans coronavirus effect on the hospitality the hospitality industry can use this chasm to prepare for the upcoming demand by focusing on marketing and up gradation this ‘stop gap plan' is about maintaining a thread of communication using social media and advertisements with the consumers it is also about strengthening the communication within the company making a budget and plan for re opening and utilizing this period to fix and upgrade whatever is possible another step is where all the action is required by the sector once the outbreak of the virus is contained and the world is set to travel again it is suggested that any plan of re opening must be done keeping long term benefits and safety compliances in mind it is imperative that hospitality companies reach out to deferred and canceled bookings and give due attention to domestic travelers the hotels and airlines must slowly roll out their services rather than starting everything instantly and not get caught up in spending this way coronavirus effect on the hospitality a way forward recommendations for the government of india the government is already taking measures to combat the effects of the pandemic on the country here are the multiple measures if taken by the government of india can help the indian hotel industry weather the current storm stimulus package to stabilize and support the hospitality sector in the near term including a workforce support fund to ensure that there are no job losses provide a moratorium of – months on all loans principal interest including working capital payments and overdrafts ensure that credit rating agencies do not downgrade ratings of businesses due to the expected volatility of the business in the short to medium term provide a month corporate tax holiday to travel tourism and hospitality sectors defer all statutory dues such as advance tax custom duties excise duties pf bank charges etc at the central and state level for months the government authorities must ensure that there is adequate availability of collateral free and interest free credit for organizations in the hospitality travel and tourism industries what will coronavirus leave behind really this is anyone's guess we do not yet know how long it will take for the epidemic to peak and for us to be allowed out again but one thing i am sure of is that we will all be desperate to meet up with friends over dinner or have a pint in the pub with proper support from the government i think the hospitality industry stands a good chance of bouncing back quickly but perhaps not in its former form it is likely that we will see a kind of natural selection take place among restaurants leaving space for innovative new entrants the crisis has already forced several restaurants to innovate by developing new services and perhaps if regulation allows these will stick becoming new models for restaurants in the future and offering them a more diverse and resilient set of revenue streams thus coronavirus effect on the hospitality and other sectors blackcoffer insights radhika kejriwal imt

96,“if anything kills over million people over the next few decades it is most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war” – bill gates bill gates in his tedx address in pointed out to the predicament of world leaders who failed to invest sufficiently into health infrastructure and he further elaborated on the inability of the prevailing health facilities to accommodate the next pandemic the world would face the whole world is grappling with covid the virus that took birth in the city of wuhan and spread across the globe claiming more than half a hundred thousand lives and affecting more than two million people with the fear of the virus spreading the whole world entered into a complete and stringent lockdown mandated by the national governments this caused economic activities worldwide to come to a standstill except for sectors that provisioned essential goods and services the international agency imf has projected that the global output will contract by in which is even worse than the financial crises moody downgraded the global growth forecast to in from an earlier estimate of the us economy is expected to contract by euro era by and china is expected to grow at rather than an earlier estimate of in the national governments have been presented with inevitable challenges of ensuring sustenance and livelihood to masses improving investor confidence and preventing the economies from falling into a recession in the absence of consumerism amidst the uncertainty about the longevity and future intensity of the pandemic the goi took the decision to enter into lockdown in the preliminary phase of the spread of the virus the indian economy in the fiscal year was already hit by severe npa crises it witnessed a downward spiral and grew at a mere rate of as against in as per the statistics released by the nso national statistical organization the manufacturing and construction sectors were negative outliers the government in order to recuperate announced a plethora of decisions the government cut the corporate tax from to and for manufacturing enterprises from to in order to strengthen the position of public sector banks the government announced the merger of public sector banks into the government also announced a fiscal stimulus of lakh crores inr stepping over its fiscal deficit target in order to drive the economy out of the downward spiral and get it on the path of growth giving lubricant to an economy facing liquidity crunch with heightening npa but the coronavirus outbreak halted the economic activity and posed government the issue of fulfilling the basic survival needs of workers in the informal sector in the wake of massive urbanization the daily wage earners tried to walk down to their native places in huge numbers posing immense difficulty for the government apart from that the domestic equity market indices the bse sensex and nse nifty crashed which reflected the erosion of investor confidence and reflected stealth of bearish sentiment around the world all this amalgamated together posed a serious question on the survival of a huge chunk of the indian population and invited a lot of criticism for the government this is when the central nda government announced a fiscal relief package the central government announced a fiscal stimulus of additional inr lakh crores that constitutes approximately of india's gdp under pradhan mantri gareeb kalyan yojna this fiscal stimulus is used to target the underprivileged section of the society instead of conventional indirectly lubricating the economy through deficit financing the government under the nfsa national food security act has decided to provide an additional kg of indian staple wheat and rice and kg of pulses every month to people with ration cards the government is expanding and accelerating the dissemination of unilateral transfers under various government schemes under pm kisan scheme an indian farmer receives payment of inr in three installments every year out of the goi had disbursed inr immediately the government has made a provision of providing installments inr for the next three months those already availing old ages women or disability pension the women who are jan dhan account holders are to receive inr for the next three months the government assured the availability of cooking gas by providing lpg cylinder for the next three months to crores people covered under ujjwal yojna the government in order to prevent the deterioration of and encourage entrepreneurial spirit in already discriminated rural women the government made a provision for women shg's where they can receive collateral free loans up to inr lakhs under nrlm national rural livelihood mission the government also enhanced payment under mgnrega from inr day to inr day the government has also taken upon itself to provide for the epf contributions of each of the basic salaries of both employees and employers for the next three months in order to ensure household liquidity the employees can withdraw from their epf accounts balance up to the goi is also providing insurance coverage if inr lakh for a tenure of months for about lakh health workers in government hospitals inclusive of asha workers medical sanitary workers and paramedics the finance minister nirmala sitaraman also pointed out that increased money supply combined with the dollar swap with the usa will help curb the inflammatory effect also shaktikanta das the rbi chief announced a monetary relief package for the economy that seemed to regain investor confidence as the national stock indices rallied the following are the elements of the package the repo rate is the rate at which the commercial banks can avail loans from rbi the rbi cut repo rate by basis points from to this reduction in the cost of borrowing from rbi gives commercial banks an incentive to enjoy increased margins by borrowing at a relatively lower rate than past and investing at the same rate i e by granting loans to businesses and households cut in reverse repo rate by basis points from to the reverse repo rate is the rate at which banks can park their funds with the rbi this primarily implies the reduction in the interest rate the banks can earn by parking their funds with the rbi this incentivizes them to lend but given the commercial bank's acquaintance with the friction caused by erosion of consumerism due to fear of covid it is hard to forecast how successful the aforementioned steps are the rbi also announced a moratorium or a provision to defer payments of emi's on home car and credit card dues for a period of months from st march st may the government also provided for interest free loans for the msme sector to meet their working capital requirements after the lockdown has been uplifted the rbi also announced a refinancing window for inr crores for financial institutions like nabard national housing bank and sidbi as the markets crashed the foreign institutional investors withdrew their investments from the indian market increasing the demand for usd and increasing the supply of inr causing the rupee to depreciate the currency hit the bottom low of inr usd to prevent further erosion in the value of rupee the rbi entered into a month swap agreement with the us government the deliberation to undertake a currency swap

98,“the more you know about the past the better prepared you are for the future ” theodore roosevelt as we speak the world finds itself engulfed in one of its worst crises in recent times the global covid pandemic has caused never seen before disruption in both public and economic life not only have factories shut down or supply chains abruptly stopped or millions of workers stranded but festivals suspended families separated across countries and public healthcare systems put under tremendous stress such a scenario is a first time for many but the world has been through pandemics of a similar scale and nature before and after the due struggle emerged victoriously as the more experienced amongst us would remember the sars and mers outbreaks in the early s presented a similar scenario although at a much lower rate of infection yet with higher rates of morbidity going back further in time the spanish flu brought a world just out of the first world war to a standstill considered to be the worst amongst modern era pandemics the influenza pandemic affected one third of the world's population and million lives yet preventive measures such as social distancing quarantine mass vaccinations public support and restraint have proved to be successful in all such situations even being effective in occasional plague outbreaks across the world we face a similar situation today – an extremely infectious virus which has already spread globally confined people to their homes and is causing tremendous economic loss every minute economic activity remains suspended affecting both the government and the industries alike can past similar incidents guide industries in such trying times can our governments take note of how public policy measures adopted during the spanish flu sars and mers outbreak helped in eliminating such pandemics what can the government learn the panic due to the outbreak of covid and more importantly the lockdown measures to deal with it are quite similar to those during the influenza pandemic or as it is more commonly referred to as the spanish flu large cities around the world were put under strict lockdowns and businesses worldwide came to a grinding halt as large chunks of the population became bedridden the immediate consequences were the same as the ones observed in the past few weeks – rampant unemployment supply shortages and heavy reliance on social security systems causing a sudden strain on national economic resources impact learnings information censorship effective and transparent communications are one of the most crucial and useful tools in disease control iran presents a great example of the damage that can be unleashed by a media blackout secondly censorship might not be the best way to appease the masses during such times the long term political impact of media censorship and manipulation of epidemic related facts in china is yet to be seen still the short term international unrest and dissent have only deteriorated international relations at the risk of quoting a cliché as well as the established streisand effect the truth always comes out no matter how many countries try to hide it isolation lockdown distancing mechanisms work the spanish flu spread was aggravated due to the failure of policymakers in adopting effective containment measures research shows that us cities which undertook measures to reduce contact amongst citizens in early displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared to cities that failed to or were too late to adopt disease containment policies to quote the results from this study “consistent with this hypothesis cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates ≈ lower than those that did not and had less steep epidemic curves they also displayed lower cumulative mortality ” contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v st louis during the influenza outbreak contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v st louis during the influenza outbreak as one might guess philadelphia was late to levy restrictions on gatherings parades and social distancing measures whereas st louis was not from the same study we see the definition of a popular phrase “flattening the curve” emerging – which is spreading out the rate of infection over time enabling health care systems to treat people in a staggered manner in line with available resources and to further corroborate this result the following graph from the same study shows the different trajectories followed by the disease in two cities of the us hence regardless of the multiple debunking claims of social distancing lockdown as an effective preventive mechanism previous epidemics have taught us that they perform a marvelous job at ‘flattening the curve' premature relaxation can be disastrous social distancing lockdown measures are effective only if sustained at least for a few months even after things start to improve markel shows the disastrous consequences that the early relaxation of bans on public gatherings in st louis had on death rates during the spanish flu the pullback of social distancing measures to pursue economic interests was premature and caused a sudden unprecedented surge in the number of deaths due to the flu deaths due to the spanish flu in st louis – a wider picture the black grey lines show the duration for which social distancing measures were active deaths due to the spanish flu in st louis – a wider picture the black grey lines show the duration for which social distancing measures were active another peak in death rates was observed only in cities that had relaxed distancing measures prematurely hence it is crucial to consider this past artifact when governments compare the inconveniences to the public damage caused to the economy due to such measures with the benefits to the nation in terms of human life saved and then make the call as to when the restrictions must be eased what can the industry learn the industry has played a key role in the obscure fight against the worldwide outbreak but it faces its fair share of challenges in such unprecedented times supply shortages due to shut down of factories production houses and the uncertainty of when production systems would resume to normal functioning transport disruptions due to closure quarantining of cities and state borders nation wide lockdowns bringing all transportation to a standstill significant disruptions in the supply chains of most goods labour issues with restrictions on movement come issues of labour welfare unrest and employment security this problem is even more serious if the labour force is migratory in nature global industries have weathered through multiple natural disasters and two epidemics of a similar scale and nature their recovery paths have immense strategic implications for current policy makers and offer strategic insights helping companies chart out their short term long term strategies this graph looks at the retail sales impact of the sars epidemic in china in the earthquake tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan in and the mers epidemic in south korea in this graph looks at the retail sales impact of the sars epidemic in china in the earthquake tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan in and the mers epidemic in south korea in three phases characterise the impact on the retail market in all these three cases shock recovery stabilization the paths inevitably converge to stabilization but follow different trajectories and are swayed by public perceptions and externalities as in the case of the mid autumn festival in south korea looking at the retail sector from a micro lens past crises show that demand trends vary amongst product categories both during and post the crisis the three categories usually follow such trends demand trends during post a pandemic generated crisis demand trends during post a pandemic generated crisis demand trends during post a pandemic generated crisis these three trends are a valuable tool for both large scale players and regional retailers who now have the means to prioritize and predict consumer demand and consequently alleviate a sudden strain on the product supply chain arising out of sudden unexpected demands change in consumer behaviour a peculiar outcome of such epidemics have been the somewhat permanent changes instilled in consumer buying trends across the inflicted regions across product categories – fresh staples see a sharp rise in their demand and product hygiene safety standards are ranked higher up in the consumers' priority list hence the advantage lies with producers who can quickly integrate changed consumer preferences in their products showcase product reliability quality and priced competitively given the prevalent context lastly previous pandemics have consolidated a long standing theory which is true not just for the retail sector but for any consumer centric industry that there is – consumer loyalty is tried and tested during these times effective consumer relationship management crm can forge bonds that go a long way weathering through the thick and thin in such unprecedented times implications almost two decades ago the sars outbreak in china had pushed entrepreneurs and established players to embrace the dawn of the e commerce era this outbreak is expected to accelerate further the shift from conventional brick mortar based commerce to a centralized online cloud store based mechanism survival in the fmcg sector at least will be decided to a great extent by the breadth of the supply chain networks and the ability to overcome severe bottlenecks the past has shown that even though established large scale players with deep pockets and extensive networks have a likelier chance to tough it through these hard times even the regional players smes make it through strengthened by community support empathy and most importantly local relationships what did we fail to learn this global pandemic outbreak has made one thing painfully clear – there is a lack of global collaborative research on ways to combat the spread of such infectious diseases in the words of johan neyts professor of virology and president of the belgian based international society for antiviral research isar health authorities failed to incorporate the learnings of the sars outbreak of the early s partly because of the economic crisis of which squeezed funds from any potential research that could have been undertaken and partly because of the lack of seriousness in authorities in considering the efforts involved in dealing with the future expected breaks of coronavirus due to its seven different strains in existence the way forward all of these lessons come with a caveat – things change with time the modes of communication have changed both information travel is much more accessible now we have fast planes faster internet we have better healthcare capabilities and a much better if not perfect healthcare system in people did not even know that a virus was causing the pandemic until much after its eradication today we already have extensive research going on for different probable vaccines for the virus with a record setting pace in clinical trials and approvals we are much better equipped than what we were years ago and at the same time somewhat under equipped to deal with it but these lessons from the various similar crises that humanity has faced and risen from act as a glimmer of hope in these dire times and if put to good use can aid in the fight against covid in the words of howard markel “there's never been a better time in human history to have a pandemic than today with the exception of next week or a month later you want to kick that can down the road but it is here today ” blackcoffer insights nishant kumar

disease which is called the covid is an infectious disease which is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus the covid virus is a virus that affects different people of the world in different ways the covid disease is a respiratory disease and most of the infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without even requiring special treatment the people who already have underlying medical conditions and those people who are over years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death common symptoms include fever tiredness dry cough other symptoms include shortness of breath aches and pains sore throat and very few people in the world will report diarrhea nausea or a runny nose the people living in this world who have only mild symptoms of this deadly disease but are otherwise healthy should self isolate and contact their medical provider or a covid information line for advice on testing and referral the people who have a fever cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention some key lessons from the deadly disease coronavirus in the last months there has been a drastic change to human life all around the world the coronavirus outbreak happening in the world is no more just an epidemic but it is also considered as a global pandemic now the people everywhere in the world are being asked to stay home and stay away from other people so as to reduce the risk of infection the deadly disease coronavirus has brought with it a wave of negative outcomes terrible illness and death but at the same time it has also highlighted some important life lessons some of them are as follows you should be willing to trade some of your freedom for the greater good of the public there is no doubt for anyone that it has been difficult for everyone in the world to stay at home many people complaining about feeling bored and aimless some people may even have the feeling that it is a breach of their individual rights being made to stay home however when it comes to the greater good one should always be willing to sacrifice a little bit of that freedom a balance between individual rights and public safety is an ever changing thing trade a little bit of your freedom for the greater good of the public you should wash your hands whether there is a virus or not general hygiene is always important not just when there is a virus you should know the drill by now wet your hands lather them with soap scrub for seconds rinse off dry with a clean towel washing hands on a regular basis are really the best way to keep safe because soap is a very effective way to kill viruses working from home should be an option for many in this time of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease many people have learned that their jobs were possible to do from home most jobs have a certain amount of work that can be done remotely without the virus in place there should still be some system in place that will promote work life balance taking that sick day from the work could save lives if you are feeling sick at any day in this situation it is highly beneficial that you just stay home it is a common feeling among lots of people that their office environment does not encourage taking sick days many people want to appear like martyrs to their managers this mentality needs to stop if you are sick just stay home the internet should be a basic right according to a study done by the university of birmingham the right to internet access also known as the right to broadband should be considered a human right many people from all over the world are unable to get online particularly the people who live in developing countries and so they lack meaningful ways to influence the global players shaping their everyday lives in addition to this during times like these it is especially important to be able to contact family friends and work from home if necessary the internet is the only way to do so the doctors and the researchers need to be paid better if this scary time has taught us anything it is that doctors and researchers will be the ones who get us out of this mess the doctors and the researchers are the only ones who are working day and night to drive the recovery of the world at the moment hundreds of scientists scramble to find a coronavirus treatment it is high time for us that we need to re evaluate how much money hollywood actors pro athletes and politicians make and instead pay the scientist and the doctors the salary they deserve everyone should know how to cook the situation that has forced everyone to stay at home has forced many people to learn re learn or re ignite their love for cooking learning how to cook is to have one of the most important skills in life you depend on yourself it teaches you self sustainability and you save a lot of money these days hundreds of people sharing social media posts of their delicious meals they are re discovering the wonders of eating in the importance of talking to friends every day now that we cannot go out and keep busy the best way to combat loneliness is to be in regular contact with friends and family by chatting over the phone or video chatting this is the time to have long talks and deep conversations do not forget human connection during these crucial times call your grandma learn to appreciate nature if you live near a spacious outdoor area like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it is the only safe surface less space to take a walk in then you start to realize how beautiful nature actually is the point is not to remain indoors but to avoid being in close contact with others when you do leave your home whether it is for a walk in the desert or a run on your street make sure to wipe down any surfaces with which you come into contact and at the same time also avoid touching your face and frequently wash your hands learn how to be content alone it is so hard for some people to just be still and do nothing being alone especially for extroverts can be exhausting and lonely social distancing can be very difficult but it can also teach you a lot about yourself you learn how to keep yourself busy your body and mind is your home and you have to learn how to love it and live with it conclusion it is rightly said that it is important to learn from the past the deadly coronavirus disease that is taking the lives of so many people across the world has taught so many life lessons to the people living in it these lessons are not meant to be forgotten but are to be

101,india has been beset by financial scams since independence every years indian citizens hear about so many trillions of public money being misappropriated and eventually lost by people who the public is supposed to start in this article with examples i would like to point out that there are two factors to scams like nirav modi the complicity of actors within the financial industry and the systemic loopholes in an emerging financial system that has been used for scams like nirav modi the first financial scam of independent india was found in when feroze gandhi mp found that in haridas mundhra got the government owned life insurance corporation lic to invest rs million about us million at the time in the shares of six troubled companies of whom mundhra held a large number of shares which he was trying to boost by rigging the market the investment was done under governmental pressure and bypassed the lic's investment committee which was informed of this decision only after the deal had gone through in the event lic lost most of the money several leading stockbrokers who were on the lic investment committee testified that the investment could not have been made for the purpose of propping up the market as was claimed by the finance ministry and that had the lic consulted the investment committee they would have pointed out mundhra's forged shares episode from the finance minister t t krishnamachari in his testimony tried to distance himself from the lic decision implying that it may have been taken by the finance secretary but justice m c chagla held that the minister is constitutionally responsible for the action taken by his secretary and he disowns his actions eventually krishanamachari had to resign the nehru government suffered considerable loss of prestige in the incident the indian stock market scam was a stock market scam orchestrated by harshad mehta the scam took place in mumbai and was the biggest market scam of india the scam was a systematic stock fraud using bank receipts and stamp paper which caused the indian stock market to crash the scam lead to a complete structural change of the security system of india and introduced a completely new system of stock transactions the scam exposed the indian financial systems through the inherent loopholes of the system this scam led to the reform of the security system of india and introduced online security systems the scam was orchestrated in such a way that mehta secured securities from the state bank of india against forged cheques signed by corrupt officials and failed to deliver the securities mehta made the prices of the stocks soar high through fictitious practices and would go on to sell the stocks that he owned in these companies the scam raises many questions which involved many bank officials responsible for collusion with mehta the scam caused an investigation through which many officials were implicated in fraudulent charges the security system of india took a rapid reform in its fundamental structure post the scam the first major structural change was the formation of the national stock exchange of india nse the first major reform in the financial sector of india was the formation of the cii code for desirable corporate governance developed by rahul bajaj post a new regulatory board known as the securities and exchange board of india was formed to monitor the national stock exchange and the national securities depository there were structural changes in the equity market the government introduced ten acts of parliament and one constitutional amendment based upon the principles of economic reform and legislative change for the equity market the nse introduced online trading in which changed the dynamics of stock buying and selling the capital market now opened up nationally as opposed to being confined in mumbai the exchange system started functioning based on satellite communications that abolished geographical barriers in ketan parekh purchased large stakes in less known small market capitalization companies and jacked up their prices through circular trading with other traders and collusion with these companies and large institutional investors this resulted in steep hikes in share prices it later transpired that promoters and industrialists often gave parekh funds to artificially rig up their share prices this set of ten stocks was colloquially referred to as “k ” stocks and parekh was playfully referred to as “pentafour” the rbi commenced an investigation against parekh around the same time a bear cartel of brokers in mumbai opposed to parekh tried to dump their shares of k stocks panicking parekh sold off his entire ownership of the so called k stocks that he had successfully jacked up over the past two years this resulted in a stock market crash the next day resulting in large scale losses for large institutional investors including insurance companies and mutual funds a member joint parliamentary committee jpc investigation ensued which found that parekh had been involved in circular trading throughout the time period from and with a variety of companies when the securities exchange board of india sebi started scanning an entire spectrum of ipos launched over and it ended digging up more dirt and probably prevented a larger conspiracy to hijack the market it involved the manipulation of the primary market—read initial public offers ipos —by financiers and market players by using fictitious or benaami demat accounts they then transferred the shares to financiers who sold on the first day of listing making windfall gains from the price difference between the ipo price and the listing price this time fraudsters targeted the primary market to make a quick buck at the expense of the gullible small investors direct participants dps used retail applicants' shares for reaping benefits in the stock market the fake housing loan in india was uncovered by the central bureau of investigation cbi in india cbi arrested eight top ranking officials of public sector banks and financial institutions including the lic housing finance ceo ramchandran nair in connection with the scam cbi alleged that the officers of various public sector banks and financial institutions received bribes from a private financial services company which acted as a mediator for corporate loans and other facilities from financial institutions the bank officials sanctioned large scale corporate loans to realty developers overriding mandatory conditions for such approvals along with other irregularities the thane police struggling to crack down on the tax refund scam that has taken the income tax department for a ride and defrauded the central exchequer of around rs crore has concluded that the scam involved high ranking officials from the i t department and the state bank of india the fraud involving two i t offices in thane and kalyan was planned by those familiar with the i t office functioning for over two years and the i t officials disbursed tax refund cheques drawn from the sbi and credited into the account of fictitious assessees in a credit society in dombivli as many as such tax refund cheques some exceeding rs lakh were subsequently routed to the dombivli nagri cooperative bank and funds withdrawn the i t refunds are account payee cheques which cannot be transferred despite this all refund orders were credited to the third party account of a credit society the saradha group financial scandal was a major financial scam and alleged political scandal caused by the collapse of a ponzi scheme run by saradha group a consortium of over private companies that were believed to be running collective investment schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as chit funds in eastern india it was feared that legitimate non banking financial companies and microfinance institutions would be stigmatized leading to a vicious cycle of low depositor trust higher interest rates lower lending and a localized credit crisis because most of the saradha group depositors came from the lowest economic strata the loss of the investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility the scandal drew attention to similar illegal deposit mobilizing companies which are facing increased regulatory pressure many of these companies have been variations of

102,it was th march and i was altogether prepared for my last theater competition of this very year i only knew in my core how much this competition meant for me in the morning i made some last minute calls to my diligent team who were ceaselessly practicing for the past few days to confirm to me that they were all coming for the competition because of the alarming coronavirus ball game going outside the market it was not like i was not aware of the situation but i believed that i would be able to handle it because there is a quote in theatre that says “fear is only as deep as the mind allows” and to some length i was fearless my passion fondness and attachment for the theatre were above all the notices and announcements that we are rolling out but then at once i received a call from mr sandeep the head of the event who told me that the event is put off till the next few days and from that precise moment onwards the journey of hard and strenuous days began and it in point of fact felt like it was all meant to happen the competition was postponed the team was stuck in their homes grudgingly time was haunting us all because of this coronavirus these were some of the cardinal ways in which this virus affected us but there was more to this sickness this very sickness acted like a sadist i was impressed as i found someone who could act better than me it has reversed the ways we used to work play and exercise and the world solution that was asked to practice by the professionals were social distancing this virus was wild and dangerous towards the people who are in declining health conditions but obviously it could not take off his hands from the young people as well the coronavirus cases and deaths were heightening to a great extent also the major problem that came in the light was people being fully unprepared and this led to the public becoming snappier intolerant and non supportive needless to say as this virus was acting like a sadist but by all means our government knows how to best handle the affairs they decided to shut down schools colleges bars anything that would involve the gathering of more than people with disinformation coming from all around related to this infection it becomes hard to judge for the audience what is true and what is false and it worsens when the public consumes this information by working from home this virus was not only hollowing people from deep inside but was also supporting and increasing some other country related issues one of which is fake news which is a serious problem with fake news traveling around the world people come and start to blabber people start offering numerous solutions and want that most of the people should follow it they start acting like saints who know all the solutions to this pandemic some of the solutions are convenient to follow but some are not and are unhealthy which creates immense confusion and arguments but the best way to stop the confusion and to avoid these people is to avoid their arguments and to not convince them with your points because it is rightly said a man convinced against his will is of the same opinions still the thing to do is to look after your family and to avoid shady and deceitful people but one thing that cannot be avoided is our expanding and maturing industries that lend a hand in developing our nation but no power to choose is left with our industries but to be at a standstill in this current moment as coronavirus right now is winning the game the untold number of industries is growing down and a major one is our tourism industries and if this continues to happen then in no time there will be a loss to jobs close to more than million many working people like in the tourism industry and not only in this peculiar industry but also in various others people are getting suspended because of a hefty amount of lost revenue one of my own family members resorted to this issue by working for free for the next few months in order to at least protect her job who should be blamed for these kinds of situations is also a point of concern for many people “massive hunger will definitely kill the poor before this virus” this statement takes my immediate attention what options are left with the daily wage earners i would say no option they are the ones who are in the most condemning situations lockdown for us can be a way to relax or listen to karaoke but lockdown for them means an end to their life unquestionably this decision by our prime minister is the best he could take but when the best turns out to be the worst for someone then i think it is a moment to question going to the internet and writing what is the best way to spend this quarantine should definitely be what is the best way in which we can help people but naturally this would not interest many people furthermore this set off to become more hell when people start with the activity of stockpiling unnecessary piling of food is altogether a reason for shortage and ultimately hunger my maid mala who is a housewife and has a small suffering family i believe could have written this article in a better manner if she would have the relevant education because she is the actual prey to this problem she being the patient will exactly know the impact this virus can have on our lives because sitting in our homes with a cup coffee can never let us know what an empty cup feels like mala said to me think how much we would be tolerating that our prime minister apologized to the public for this lockdown which was certainly a good thing for the masses what all i could do to help her was to provide her family with some money and eatables a small contribution with some motivation and a call once in days i believe will not improve her state completely but would certainly provide her with the power to deal with it not only mala and her family but there are also millions of people who are in the exact same condition there are countless mala in our country who are panicking enduring and suffering each night with no food in their stomachs imagine an exact same situation for yourselves it would without fail be the hardest situation this is the impact a virus can create for sure this article can be of endless pages owing to the fact that there are more stories to to this and each story is painful that the other labor chowk in noida has numerous stories of people conveying their problems and asking for help this chowk is in the main know for men looking for work quite a few men gather there each morning to get some work in order to feed their families with at least a roti but this virus even snatched that from their plates a very known movie in our indian cinemas is “coolie” that says these laborers should get their pay till their sweat dries up these people anyhow need money each day to feed their families but after these uncontrollable situations they at times are forced to eat filth and muck and this sickness might not kill these people but hunger and stained water definitely will these stories will never end because it is all meant to happen but i hope this situation does in order to provide some relief to them also how one would imagine that the movie “six feet's apart” would be acted in reality the solutions related to this pandemic came swiftly and rapidly with the help and support of your doctors and nurses who all were serving us and the sufferers round the clock solutions like washing your hands for at least seconds correctly covering your mouth with a face mask and majorly avoiding unnecessary wandering on the streets and keeping yourself away from unhygienic people were asked to follow the efforts of our doctors nurses government officials made me realize that my passion should

103,nathan wolfe impact once said “there are commonalities among all the pandemics that occur and what we can learn from them one commonality is that it comes from animals and the other one is that we wait too long ” in the year plague in the year cholera outbreak and the most recent pandemic was the spanish flu of the researchers said that all of these pandemics above have exactly the same pattern as the coronavirus outbreak however the precision with which these pandemics occur at exactly years of age makes us think better about this topic coronavirus disease covid is one such infectious disease that has been declared a global pandemic by who most people infected with the covid virus experience mild to moderate illness and recover without requiring special treatment older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses the best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the covid virus the disease it causes and how it spreads people can protect themselves and others from infection by washing their hands or using an alcohol based sanitizer frequently and by not touching their face the covid virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes so it is important that you also practice respiratory etiquettes for example by coughing into a flexed elbow etc at this time there are no specific vaccines or treatments for covid however there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments the first case of this pandemic in india was reported on january th after which it has increased substantially around the country to such an extent that the indian prime minister announced a day lockdown around the country rating agencies both global and domestic are unanimous that the covid pandemic will be an economic tsunami for india even though the country may not slip into a recession unlike the eurozone the us or asia pacific that have stronger trade ties to china analysts believe the impact on india's gdp growth will be significant the fallout of the move will spill over to the financial year which begins on april moody's investors service on march sharply slashed its projection for india's gdp growth in the calendar year from to the markdown was the second in days and came after prime minister narendra modi announced the day lockdown in its global macro outlook moody's cited severe liquidity constraints in india's banking and non banking sectors as a hindrance to growth the agency's forecast for the global economy was even more stark—a contraction of in the ongoing financial year “lower business volumes and occupancies and sub optimal efficiencies will impact the profitability of companies while some affected companies may initiate cost curtailment measures these may not be enough given their high fixed costs that could impair their credit files ” says subodh rai senior director crisil neeraj kumar a migrant worker decided to flee he and his family joined a throng of people leaving the city soon after the lockdown announcement was made public transport systems were stopped leaving people with no choice but to walk mr kumar his wife and their year old daughter had already walked more than km miles when we spoke to him “there is no work here that is why we are running away there are no buses i have to walk another km to get to my village ” he said the situation of workers following the lockdown is no better mohammad alam is one of the thousands of workers standing in a food queue in india's capital delhi the factory where he worked has shut down after prime minister narendra modi announced a day lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus a daily wage laborer he has no other source of income so he has been forced to come to a government center for food “i do not know how i will survive i will have to borrow to feed my family ” he says india has announced a bn £bn relief package to help people like mr alam and mr kumar who are part of india's unorganized informal industry that employs of the population and contributes to its overall output this industry is already bearing the brunt of the lockdown with thousands of finding themselves unemployed overnight “no one will be allowed to go hungry ” finance minister nirmala sitharaman said while announcing the package – a combination of direct cash transfer benefits and food security measures but the economic fallout of this unprecedented lockdown has been dire businesses have closed unemployment has risen and productivity has fallen india's growth engine was actually sputtering well before the threat of the outbreak arrived once one of the fastest growing economies in the world its growth slowed to last year – the lowest level in six years unemployment was at a year high last year the industrial output from the eight core sectors at the end of last year fell by – the worst in years small businesses had only just begun to recover from the controversial currency ban that came as a body blow to the cash consuming informal economy now experts say the coronavirus outbreak is likely to further cripple the already frail economy there is little finance minister nirmala sitharaman and rbi governor shatikanta das can do if covid forces a virtual lockdown of commercial hubs in india like it had done in china and has in italy lights out in mumbai and delhi alone the nerve centers of india will cause great damage to the indian economy indeed covid can be a massive blow to the slowing indian economy particularly small business the sme sector which had recently shown improvement since demonetization took place this is a war like situation for the indian economy as the malls and theatres are empty schools are shut for contingencies and some states have even announced a complete shutdown of all services so while most welcome the government's measures they feel much more is needed to be done to minimize the economic impact “while free extra rations have been sanctioned how will the poor access what is due to them ” wonders economist arun kumar “the government should devise a way of using the army and state machinery to physically distribute food to the poor ” with thousands of migrant workers stuck miles away from their homes the seamless distribution of cash and food needs to be the government's top priority he adds and it is not just migrant workers at risk farmers are also vulnerable to a potential economic shock from the lockdown – the agriculture industry contributes nearly bn to gdp the government says it will give farmers rupees in april as an advance payment from an annual pay out to tide over the situation “this money will be inadequate because exports have stopped prices in cities will rise because of profiteering and in rural areas they will drop because farmers will not be able to sell their crop ” says economist arun kumar the outbreak has happened at a critical farming time – the new crop is ready waiting to be sold economists warn india's challenge will be in transporting this food from villages to cities in the midst of the lockdown if supply chains do not work properly a lot of food will be wasted and lead to massive losses for indian farmers experts warn that india is also at the brink of a major unemployment crisis economist vivek kaul says people who work for small businesses may end up with job and salary losses “i know of places where companies are actively discussing how many people they need to fire ” he says and that is not all while no sector is immune to covid disruption some are more vulnerable the tourism industry will see greater disruptions the world travel and tourism council calculated that tourism generated of the gdp and supported million jobs tourism dependent states like kerala karnataka earn huge forex but if the disease continues many operators will be forced to go out of the business in the exports industry while the gloom and doom surrounding covid are palpable the crisis might also throw up some great opportunities for india there are already reports of several western manufacturers looking at moving their factories out of china many indian chemical producers have gone on record at having received inquiries from western manufacturers who earlier never used to look towards india as a source tapping these opportunities however will require some serious innovation on the policy front indian policymakers need to hunker down and plan economic assistance that will not only help india's export sector survive the immediate crisis but also retain stability and resume growth in the medium to long term with flights suspended until mid april the shutdown is also bound to push india's fast growing aviation industry into peril the centre for asia pacific aviation capa has assessed that the indian aviation industry will post losses worth nearly bn this year this will likely have a cascading effect affecting the hospitality and tourism industries hotels and restaurant chains across the country are empty and are likely to remain so for several months sparking worries of large scale layoffs the automobile industry a key indicator of a country's economic growth has also been forced to hit the brakes – experts are estimating losses of nearly bn so is india's relief package enough experts say it is a drop in the ocean compared to bailouts in countries such as the us china and singapore the stimulus package constituting about percent of fy gdp is not at par to address the urgent needs of smaller businesses experts say that india definitely needs a larger stimulus package soon to help businesses this extraordinary crisis desperate times call for desperate measures india has done well in containing this dangerous virus but should act

104,introduction coronavirus disease covid is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus most people infected with this covid virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory disease and recover without requiring special treatment older age people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness the best way to prevent and slow down transmission is well informed about the covid virus the disease it causes and how it spreads protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face the covid virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharges from the nose when an infected person suffering from coughs or sneezes so it is important that you also practice respiratory etiquette for example by coughing into a flexed elbow at this time there are no specific vaccines or treatments for this virus however there are many ongoing clinical trials calculating potential treatments which will continue to provide regular basis information as soon as clinical findings become available impact the emergence of covid is a tragic public health emergency the disease one hopes will be brought under control quickly but the international monetary fund is already warning that economic growth in china may slow as we watch the situation unfold three broader risks to the global economy are also becoming more apparent and clear the first risk is obviously in china itself while the precise origins of the disease remain unclear it is hard to take a definite view on whether outbreaks of this kind could be avoided – for example by better control over hygiene in food markets but it is painfully obvious that a lack of transparency in china has contributed to fear and even signs of panic around the world as financial markets go down in when the precise incidence of big risks is not well understood people tend to assume the worse rapidly falling asset prices may not contain much information–except that there is not much information to be had the chinese authorities surely do not have all the answers at this point but their inclination to suppress data and interpretation is tremendously unhelpful second the lack of american leadership is more painfully apparent every day the united states has the strongest medical health system and facilities in the world with the capacity for research and development government and private that is second to none yet president donald trump's administration seems to be concerned primarily with playing down the risks while keeping the virus out of the united states of america – a nearly impossible task the private sector is working hard on a vaccine and this is commendable unfortunately over a longer period of time the lack of a consistent market for such vaccines has undermined investment in this sector by creating the world's largest market for many drugs the us effectively supports research across a wide range of ailments – but only those for which there is large and steady demand in the us even the most fervent believer in trump's “america first” must be willing to concede that it is not in america's interest for the rest of the world to become sick these are us allies friends and customers also like it or not few diseases will stop at america's borders indeed the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc has said that the question is not if but rather when covid spreads domestically the third risk is in emerging markets and developing countries poorer countries are ill equipped to deal with this kind of disease as seen in african countries' refusal to airlift their citizens from china the news that the coronavirus has reached italy has shaken world financial markets but italy is a relatively well organized and rich country a vibrant democracy ensures that people will quickly understand if containment and treatment measures are working we should be much more concerned about other countries where nutrition is worse housing standards are weak and disease transmission can occur much more readily if these countries' health systems come under pressure the us europe and others should step up quickly with technical assistance and essential supplies but here too there is so far a worrying lack of leadership it seems unlikely that this disease will prove to be as deadly as some of those that our ancestors experienced medical practice and public health have advanced a great deal the cdc is an outstanding organization and the world health organization has a strong track record when the chips are down private sector groups of dedicated doctors and nurses have performed extraordinarily well under the most difficult circumstances such as dealing with ebola when they are given a chance we are fortunate to live in an age that has so many heroic people still this coronavirus is a warning societies neglect access to health care systems and reduce investments in research and development at great peril diseases are always evolving and we must continually increase our capacity to understand and fight newly emerging threats the best way forward is by strengthening science training more scientists and building more labs countries that are able to do this like the us should share ideas and knowledge as widely as possible investing more in science is an appealing economic proposition given very high rates of social return basic research across a wide range of activities more than pays for itself but this is not about economics more likely than not one day a scientist will save your life or the life of a loved one because his or her previous work produced a drug treatment or just an idea that made a critical difference we should invest in scientists to save ourselves and our neighbors also we must remember that we have neighbors all over our deeply interconnected world global shares take a hit big shifts in stock markets where shares in companies are bought and sold can affect many investments in pensions or individual savings accounts isas the ftse dow jones industrial average and the nikkei have all seen huge falls since the outbreak began on december the dow and the ftse recently saw their biggest one day declines since investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that government action may not be enough to stop the decline in response central banks in many countries including the united kingdom have slashed interest rates that should in theory make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy global markets did also recover some ground after the us senate passed a trillion £ tn coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses but some analysts have warned that they could be volatile until the pandemic is contained indian economy india faces a sharp decline in government revenues and economic growth for at least two quarters as the coronavirus hits economic activity and a fall in investor sentiment impacts privatization plans government and industry sources said officially the government is still sticking to the target of achieving in the next financial year beginning april while hoping that a fall in crude oil prices could help it garner more revenue and contain a fall in revenue from other sectors but economists and bankers are turning increasingly downbeat about india's economic prospects especially as the government is betting on filling its coffers through ill timed asset sales we are going to miss the revised revenue targets for the current fiscal year and will have to lower next year's targets as well ” said a senior government official with direct knowledge of budget estimates he said receipts from much delayed privatization of india's second biggest oil refiner bharat petroleum corp could be lower by at least billion against initial estimates the company's share prices have fallen by over since january while the broader nse nifty index has fallen by nearly following a panic in global markets on wednesday the government suspended almost all visas to the country till april to prevent the spread of coronavirus as cases across the region continue to rise total cases in the country rose to on thursday according to the government another senior finance ministry official said some of the proposed share shale plans in companies like coal india steel authority of india ltd sail nmdc and ircon have been deferred the government now expects to raise about rs crore billion against the downwardly revised target of rs crore for the ongoing financial year ending in march the official said another senior official in the tax department said receipts have been hit due to a fall in consumer demand as reflected in the lower sales of autos passenger traffic hotel bookings and retail sales tour operators estimate january march quarter earnings could fall by more than from a year ago as hundreds of thousands of tourists cancel travel hitting hotels airlines and tax collection for the federal and state governments india attracts nearly one million foreign tourists a month and the travel restrictions could impact for the next few months the situation in india was still far better compared to some other countries hit by a global pandemic sarkar said india annually earns nearly billion from foreign tourist arrivals and the industry is worried that a global spread of the virus will harm already weakened economic growth as this situation will take time to recover and economy not only of india but globally is in a recession it up to government how they come up with their measure if we look at recent action of us fed and other countries step it took a thought that this pressure is deeper than it looks like and this situation is very different than that happen in crisis or that in as that time none of the factories are closed but this time work has been stoped and more importantly economy from past year is facing slow down in many sectors so this will impact small companies badly but if we think in another way there will be a shift in a lot of pattern like people will now go for short term investment in the stock market due to uncertainty of life insurance stocks will be benefited logistics distribution network will totally change as factories will now try to procure material from nearest location and there will be an increase in the personal saving of people because of which automakers and real estate sector may be hit hard if we estimate it will take around year to get back in a track from now and all this will happen if the government and central bank continuously come up with relief measure blackcoffer insights vishant agrawal ibs gurgaon,78,introduction coronavirus disease covid infectious disease caused newly discovered

105,from the economic point of view india is confronted today with perhaps its greatest emergency since independence the global financial crisis in was a gigantic demand shock but our workers could still get up and go to work our firms were coming off years of steady growth our financial system was largely sound and our government finances were blooming none of this is true today as we fight the coronavirus pandemic yet there is also no reason to despair with the right undertakings and priorities and drawing on india's many sources of strength it can kill this virus back and even set the stage for a much more hopeful tomorrow the rampant spread of covid outbreak across borders and geographies has severely impacted almost the whole world and triggered significant downside risks to the overall global economic outlook steps taken to contain its spread such as the nationwide lockdown announced by the indian government have brought economic activity to a near – standstill with impacts

impact on the demand side private consumption the lockdown is likely to have a sizeable impact on the economy most significantly on consumption which is the biggest component of gdp steep fall in the consumption of non essential goods due to a significant reduction in urban transactions severe impact on the domestic supply chain disruptions due to the –day lockdown can affect the availability of essential commodities weak domestic consumption and consumer sentiment will have firms delay their investment and putting additional pressure on growth informal sector rajasthan punjab andhra pradesh chhattisgarh and gujarat are among the top five states with the highest urban informal workers non–agriculture around percent of regular salaried employees in urban india are informal workers who will face uncertain income following the stalling of urban activity inr trillion stimulus package focused majorly on cash transfer and food security was unveiled the income shock to migrant workers has resulted in a massive reverse migration the effect of which will only unravel over time impact on the supply side the shutdown of factories and the resultant delay in the supply of goods in china could result in the supply chain of both raw materials and intermediate goods for indian companies importing from there while disruption in output in china could impact some indian industries the economy at large may be relatively insulated given its low reliance on intermediate goods from china as well as the common practice in indian firms of stockpiling inventory another challenge is the disruptions of the domestic supply chain due to the lockdown which may create a shortage of inputs for indian firms when they restart their operations figure showing supply chain disruptions source the economic times what has been done so far india has already undertaken the following measures to counter the impact from of the pandemic a three week countrywide lockdown and fiscal steps coupled with monetary measures from the rbi to provide relief for all especially the vulnerable and the disadvantaged a government has directed the employers to not terminate or cut wages particularly that of casual or contractual workers and low paid workers to also take paid sick leave and unemployment allowance through the insurance cover government to contribute to both employees' and employers' share in the employees' employees' provident fund rbi relaxes lending norms for banks injects cash into the system slashes interest rates and relaxes repayments for three months managing the pandemic and the resultant public health crisis protecting income and employment particularly for the disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the society what can the corporates do the crisis is a story with an uncertain ending however what is clear that the covid has introduced new challenges to the business environment which called for a measured practical and informed approach from political and business leaders a company needs to think and act across five horizons resolve address the immediate challenges that covid represents the institution's workforce customers technology and business partners resilience address near term cash management challenges and broader resiliency issues during virus related shutdowns and economy knock on effect return create a detailed plan to return the business to scale quickly as covid situation evolves and knock on effects become clearer reimagination re imagine the next normal what a discontinuous shift looks like and implications for how institutions should re invent reform be clear about how regulatory and competitive environments in india may shift figure showing the crisis as a lesson to businessmen in assessing risk to their business source the economic times collectively these five stages epitomize the inescapable of our time the battle against covid is one that leaders today must win in order to find an economically and socially feasible path to the next normal what can the government do the government should consider certain measures in order to manage the pandemic the following steps and the recognition of the likely scenarios for the indian economy can enable policymakers to identify appropriate countermeasures to stem the spread of the pandemic build a national database of the reachable physical health infrastructure and medical and para medical resources the public and private health care facilities can be segregated by labeling a section of accessible hospital beds for treating covid patients only extend additional one time budgetary support to augment the public health care system in terms of facilities equipment and human resources capacity earmark financial resources to provide one time grants financial support to research institutions and leading pharmaceutical biotechnology medical equipment companies extend the coverage of ayushman bharat and other applicable insurance schemes to covid if not already included tweak the existing customs duty structure for select components which are essential for manufacturing testing kits ventilators etc enable access to funds for businesses to run their day to day operations and service their debt ensure the smooth supply of essential products and commodities to contain the economic impact of the covid outbreak provide credit support to medium and small enterprises encourage investments such as one time set off of capital investments made by corporates for income tax computations therefore the question remains whether the stimulus is enough or not – both quantitatively and qualitatively would it be able to help the economy absorb the shock of the lockdown compared to what the usa trillion usd germany billion usd uk billion usd france billion usd spain billion usd china billion usd and italy billion usd the spending by india crore – billion usd may prima facie appear to be insufficient however such a comparison is not easy and straightforward because a lot of factors are to be taken into account in addition the important factor that needs to be considered is whether at this point in time the country is able to spend more than this or not against a revised budget estimate of rs crore for towards tax collections the collection as on st dec was to the tune of rs crore only with a clearly huge shortfall in addition a substantial amount would also have to be spent now to tackle the pandemic which is of utmost priority on top of it huge additional spending would jeopardize the fiscal deficit discipline although at times of emergency fiscal deficit should not be a matter of concern at all it would also have to be seen how long this virus continues to affect india and going by the hygiene standard and herd mentality that we have the virus continues to affect us beyond months and extends to months quite obviously these packages would be grossly insufficient and more money will have to be pumped into the economy if the need arises currency notes will have to be printed and circulated and concerns about higher fiscal deficit should be simply pushed to the backseat the corporate sector and a section of large hearted people have also come forward at this time of distress to support the government initiatives in fighting this menace which should provide some financial comfort to the government the pandemic has appeared from nowhere as a potential death knell to the world economy which is already under stress and india is no exception there is no second opinion that this pandemic has hit the world very hard and would continue to do so in the foreseeable future whether india can emerge from the medical pandemic as well as the economic pandemic relatively unscathed remains to be seen we

106,in today's day and age of hyper connectivity celebrities – dubbed by fraser and brown as people who are famous for being famous and may or may not always serve others sacrificially – live in glass houses that are open to the prying eyes of the public notification bars are ever abuzz with news about when these celebrities wake up what they wear to the gym what they eat and where they go on their vacations in the idealized and idolized eyes with which society views celebrities this unceasing visibility gives them an all pervasive influence the dominance of celebrities in swaying opinions of their acolyte is well established – from advertisements in the print and pixel mediums brand endorsements and integrations the evidence of exploiting celebrity influence is vast however today more than ever before this influence is creeping away from the world of consumerism and into governance policy and politics with an increasing number of public figures overtly taking strong and stronger political stances making moves charged with a political motive and eventually entering the sphere of legislature and bureaucracy the scope of having a public influence has come to mean much more than it used to thereby begging the question – how well placed are personage in the world of politics should celebrities be allowed to join politics the interplay between the seemingly contrasting worlds of celebrities and policy makers have come into increasing contact in india and the rest of the world leading pop music artists back presidential candidates internationally acclaimed actors attempt international diplomacy films are claimed to be vehicles of political messaging prime ministerial banquets engage celluloid stars and so on the ‘influence' that stars exert on the world of politics seems to encapsulate an entire spectrum of involvement – at the zenith of which are the celebrities who actually set foot into parliamentary assemblies and councils to represent the public that they once only influenced although the phenomenon of the seeping of public influence into public policy has stretched through much of the th century choi and berger suggest that the celebrity politics connect continues to strengthen much more than it did a few decades ago as we trudge further into the century of the myriad causalities that underlie this circumstance the global internet where fame is not restricted to the confines of tangible achievement has been theorized to be a significant driver in her book hyde labels this spectacle as a ‘mission creep' where the enterprise of celebrities is expanding beyond its primary goals a prodigious public following seems to be the parallel between the worlds of politics and personage which paves the path for celebrities to cross over to politics celebrities seem to be able to transition into politics with a certain grace having already learned to live in the public's eye and established themselves allowing the carry over of their already known traits as celebrities into their role as policy makers the visibility that autochthonous politicians work years to nurture celebrities already have as they descend into the political sphere in one of the best known instances of a celebrity transitioning into politics ronald reagan walked away from hollywood and into the white house carrying with him his trademark charismatic on screen personality that spilled over into his politics initially serving as the governor of california for years in the late s reagan served two terms at the oval office the voters knew who ronald was – those who closely followed the trends of the red and blue – but also those who did not giving reagan the edge that propelled him towards success on the other side of the globe india saw much the same trend as an on screen persona aiding the creation of an off screen political career ramanand sagar's television series ‘ramayan' based on the hindu mythological epic was revolutionary in the pious indian society of the s when television shows were still novel it has been recounted on many an occasion that audiences would often offer their prayers to the television screen every time arun govil who portrayed the deity ‘ram' made an appearance on screen having garnered a devout dutiful fan following govil and his other co actors from the show turned to the world of politics where their godly association in the public's eyes helped them make a mark even the philippines has shown ample evidence of celebrities time and again swooping in to claim political victory with their stardom and popularity that their opponents lack very often the sentiment of anti incumbency seems to be the golden ticket that lets celebrity politicians snatch political power from consummate politicians indeed various political theorists suggest that anti incumbency happens to be amongst the more effective strategies to secure vote banks until st december ukrainian actor screenwriter and director volodymyr zelensky only played the lead in a sitcom that tells the story of a schoolteacher who accidentally becomes the president it was that winter that zelensky claimed that he was contesting the presidential elections to “change the mood and timbre of the political establishment” and to “bring professional decent people to power” zelensky took the premise of his wildly popular show from the reel to the real as he crushed rival a seasoned politician and incumbent poroshenko in a landslide victory has zelensky proved a better representative of his people than his predecessor time is yet to deliver its verdict but the gushes that he invoked in the people of ukraine and his plea to oust ‘the ruling class' played their role in assuring zelensky of the plebiscite in the early s in india similar anti incumbent sentimentalities were played into by the many celebrities including musician vishal dadlani hockey legend dhanraj pillay singer jaspinder narula and others – all of whom joined hands with arvind kejriwal's ‘aam aadmi' movement that aimed to rid the existing political system of its ills and so innumerable celebrities across countries and cultures claim the throne in fact a wikipedia page that maintains an inventory of actor politician spanning the atlas claims that it ‘may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness' – depicting the sheer number of celebrities who reroute to politics this begets questioning the congruence of the world of personage and that of politics in a research article published in meyer and gamson articulated the possibility of celebrities choosing to politically address only broadly acceptable social causes because they understand their power rests with staying popular thereby failing to make any appreciable difference this seems to ring true with some celebrity politicians in india especially ones who are nominated to the upper house of the parliament but fail abysmally to leave a mark one of many such representatives is gautam gambhir a cricketer turned politician who has mostly been shunned for his abject performance in the parliament hema malini another popular actress who turned to politics came under heavy criticism when her claim to be a protector of women's rights was not backed by an effort to fulfill her promises owing to such instances research findings such as those by nisbett and dewalt find that the public often questions the intentions of the celebrities who venture into politics it may also seem that in entering politics and failing to deliver celebrity politicians often deprive grass root political workers of the chance to enter the mainstream of politics however there is ample evidence from around the globe that goes to prove that celebrities can in fact make their mark in the world of governance independent of their primary identities take the south indian state of tamil nadu for instance where the political ethos has been consistently overshadowed by celebrities from the world of showbiz for at least the last years as per data from the ministry of statistics programme implementation tamil nadu is amongst the top performing states in the country having the second highest gdp most celebrities in tamil nadu who approached politics have exhibited extraordinary political will and caliber the late actor politician j jayalalithaa or ‘amma' ran successful terms as chief minister and is still considered a mother figure by hordes of her followers another stalwart in the landscape of tamil nadu dr mg ramachandran continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential chief ministers and is lauded for his large scale reforms in being the forerunner of some of the changes that propelled the state towards progress including easing caste tensions and other communal violence ‘mgr' as he is better known is remembered as much for his governance as he is for his innings on screen more often than not celebrity engagement in politics has been used to woo voters from the younger strata of the population empirical studies such as the one by austin vord pinkleton and epstein have conclusively shown to enhance political engagement by younger voters along similar lines jackson found that young people are more likely to agree with political positions that are endorsed by politicians in fact many modern political theorists are of the belief that the involvement of celebrities in politics allows for otherwise uninvolved or apathetic veins of the demographic to be active participants in democracy hillary clinton aimed to do just that when she got the billboard topping artists beyonce and jay z to take center stage at her rally in cleveland in the weeks leading up to the us presidential elections – in fact as multiple sources suggest this rally did see a surge in millennial supporters in such a case it might be in the benefit of the community to have more celebrities endorse and engage in politics in order to nurture a more vibrant and engaged youth from our vantage point today the relationship between personage and politics seems to be a central fixture in society and is here to stay what remains to be done however is to ensure the symbiotic course of this relationship – to scrutinize and critique the celebrities who knock the doors of politics and to secure their promises of beneficence and non maleficence to the public that it seeks to serve yet it may seem that these are benchmarks that need to be met by any and all servants of the people – celebrity or not but in the world that we live in this is certainly not the case politicians – celebrity or not largely happen upon the sphere of governance without a lot of experience backing them and learn to navigate the maze of politics on the job ultimately like all things in democracy the government is of the people and its representatives are of them and for them the eventual endorsement of its leaders – celebrity or not – can come not from data based analyses and elaborate critique but from the people should celebrities be allowed to enter politics the question remains unanswered or rather is answered by the democratic exercise itself –

107,frankly no the state of the public healthcare system still vast is very fragmented and cannot scale up rapidly enough to face the challenge of a pandemic such as covid the origin of public healthcare lies in the british colonial period where such facilities were provided only to british officers and their families stationed in india from the s onwards the independent government of india stressed more upon healthcare and it led to the creation of the modern public healthcare system in india the healthcare system is organized into primary secondary and tertiary levels at the primary level are sub centre's and primary health centre's phcs at the secondary level there are community health centre's chcs and smaller sub district hospitals finally the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level which consists of medical colleges and district general hospitals the number of phcs chcs sub centre's and district hospitals has increased in the past six years although not all of them are up to the standards set by indian public health standards but there are still critical challenges to the existing system one of the major areas is the lack of awareness of diseases especially communicable diseases among the general population of india this challenge becomes more complicated at the lower strata of society especially poor households migrant laborers and homeless people who do not have the proper channels of communication available to get the necessary information from the health experts add low educational status poor functional literacy low accent on education within the healthcare system and low priority for health in the population among others and you see the magnitude of the problem according to a recent study initiated by the faculty and students of iit hyderabad and iit bombay in tier cities it was found that about percent of the respondents switched from public to private mode during the third week of covid this modal shift was about percent in tier cities and about percent in tier cities moreover nearly percent of people said that they did not travel to work during the third week of march whereas percent had the same frequency of travel to work when inquired about the cancellation of trips between the cities using major modes of transportation around percent said they cancelled their flights whereas per cent of respondents cancelled their train journeys this indicates that awareness about covid is higher in tier cities in comparison with tier and tier cities but national level state level and door to door campaigns along with targeted media campaigns may enable the knowledge of the pandemic to spread fast among the local populace the second challenge is access to public healthcare in india access to healthcare is defined by the oxford dictionary as “the right or opportunity to use or benefit from healthcare ” physical reach is one of the basic determinants of access defined as “ the ability to enter a healthcare facility within km from the place of residence or work” using this definition a study in india in found that in rural areas only of people were able to access ip facilities within a km distance and were able to access out patient facilities furthermore it was postulated that in general the more rustic rural one's existence – the further one lives from towns – the greater are the odds of disease malnourishment weakness and premature death the third is the planning portion related to the preparedness of the pandemic planning for a pandemic such as covid has never been done extensively in india as we had no recent history of such a communicable disease which spreads rapidly in crowded locations which about a quarter of the population live in the recent national lockdown called led to an increase in police violence who have not been sensitized how to deal in such a crisis and the humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers an important part of the indian economy who have lost their jobs and facing a lack of public transport have to force to walk thousands of miles to reach their native villages the ongoing slump in the economy has been further exacerbated by the pandemic and the resultant lockdown and there have been growing complaints by healthcare professionals who are fighting in the front of this pandemic of lack of protective personal equipment's ppe's to protect themselves and their patients from covid the lockdown has hit hiv and chronic patients hard who need constant medication to maintain their fragile condition elderly people who are often alone and have medical conditions have been left without essential support ironically these are the same group of people who are at an immediate threat from covid i am optimistically hoping based on the ingenious and creativity of our citizens that we tide over these tough times and fundamental changes to our healthcare system are made with this sober learning experience to prevent a repeat of what is happening today blackcoffer insights sandeep chakravartty,32,frankly state public healthcare system vast fragmented scale rapidly face challenge pandemic covid origin public healthcare lies

108,every prophet of doom unless he also happens to be a psychopath hopes that his predictions will not be borne out this is also true for the epidemiologists and virologists who have been warning the world since january that the novel sars cov virus poses a severe threat to public health around the world the name coronavirus itself is vicious enough to terrify those who otherwise are fearless in the face of any ball game tracing back the origins of the now pandemic we find that the coronavirus emerged in wuhan a city of million people in china's hubei province in late cases of the disease grew by several thousand per day in china in late january and early february the peak of the epidemic there the number of infections appearing each day has since plummeted in china making the outbreak a global pandemic that has engulfed over countries around the globe besides being a health crisis the virus has already brought a major downfall in the world economy with the imf estimating the coronavirus induced global downturn to be ‘way worse' than financial crisis as the coronavirus spreads across the globe it appears to be setting off a devastating feedback loop with another of the gravest forces of our time economic inequality research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease owing to their inability to meet the rising drug prices according to the international labour organization ilo covid will have far reaching impacts on labor market outcomes beyond the urgent concerns about the health of workers and their families the virus and the subsequent economic shocks will impact the world of work across three key dimensions initial ilo estimates point to a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment in the wake of the virus based on different scenarios for the impact of covid on global gdp growth preliminary ilo estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between million “low” scenario and million “high” scenario from a base level of million in the “mid” scenario suggests an increase of million million in high income countries though these estimates remain highly uncertain all figures indicate a substantial rise in global unemployment for comparison the global financial crisis of increased unemployment by million while self employment does not typically react to economic downturns it acts as a “default” option for survival or maintaining income – often in the informal economy for this reason informal employment tends to increase during crises however the current limitations on the movement of people and goods may restrict this type of coping mechanism labour supply is declining because of quarantine measures and a fall in economic activity at this point a preliminary estimate suggests that infected workers have already lost nearly work months with the consequent loss of income for unprotected workers employment impacts imply large income losses for workers overall losses in labour income are expected in the range of between and billion usd the loss of labour income will translate into lower consumption of goods and services which is detrimental to the continuity of businesses and ensuring that economies are resilient working poverty is also likely to increase significantly the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line the growth impacts of the virus used for the unemployment estimates above suggest an additional million people in working poverty around the world than originally estimated i e an overall decline of million working poor in compared to a decline of million estimated pre covid under the mid and high scenarios there will be between million and million more people in working poverty than before the pre covid estimate for who are particularly vulnerable epidemics and economic crises can have a disproportionate impact on certain segments of the population which can trigger worsening inequality based on past experience and current information on the covid pandemic and insights from previous crises a number of groups can be identified those with underlying health conditions and older people are most at risk of developing serious health issues young persons already facing higher rates of unemployment and underemployment are more vulnerable to falling labor demand as witnessed during the global financial crisis women are over represented in more affected sectors such as services or in occupations that are at the front line of dealing with the pandemic e g nurses the ilo estimates that percent of employed women work in the services sector around the world compared to percent of men unprotected workers including the self employed casual and gig workers are likely to be disproportionately hit by the virus as they do not have access to paid or sick leave mechanisms and are less protected by conventional social protection mechanisms and other forms of income smoothing migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the covid crisis which will constrain both their ability to access their places of work in destination countries and return to their families the extent and severity to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact the fight to end extreme poverty is still unknown but it is expected that the crisis will devastate the world's most vulnerable people including the world of work the virus is already disproportionately impacting the poor in wealthy countries where the most known cases are concentrated experts are urging the world to prepare to lend extra support to low income countries to address the pandemic covid cases are more likely to go undetected or to be under detected in developing countries that have fewer resources available to tackle a pandemic countries with large poor populations including brazil india indonesia nigeria and pakistan have confirmed few cases but have been slow to respond to the threat according to npr preventative care and health education are less accessible to low income people who are more likely to have pre existing conditions catch covid and die from it people living in poverty are also more likely to hold insecure jobs and cannot afford to stay home sick from work in times of crisis international labour standards provide a strong foundation for key policy responses that focus on the crucial role of decent work in achieving a sustained and equitable recovery to mitigate the impacts of covid on the world of work these standards adopted by representatives of governments workers' and employers' organizations provide a human centered approach to growth and development including by triggering policy levers that both stimulate demand and protect workers and enterprises policy responses should focus on two immediate goals health protection measures and economic support on both the demand and supply side of the associated cause first workers and employers and their families should be protected from the health risks of covid protective measures at the workplace and across communities should be introduced and strengthened requiring large scale public support and investment second timely large scale and coordinated policy efforts should be taken to provide employment and income support and to stimulate the economy and labor demand these measures not only cushion enterprises and workers against immediate employment and income losses but they also help prevent a chain of supply shocks e g losses in workers' productivity capacities and demand shocks e g suppressing consumption among workers and their families that could lead to a prolonged economic recession in such challenging times many countries have come forward to protect their workers in the workplace with decisive measures to combat the spread of the disease while ameliorating its pernicious effect on the economy and labor market across the three policy pillars protecting workers in the workplace stimulating the economy and labor demand and supporting employment and income some of the policies include working arrangements including telework occupational safety and health osh advice expanded access to paid sick leave prevention of discrimination and exclusion while these measures will no doubt help to contain the pandemic to respond to the emergency needs it has generated and to pave the way to a gradual recovery it is clear that more needs to be done past crises and the experiences of countries which have reacted too late in the context of the current covid crisis show that preparedness and early action is critical the coronavirus pandemic is a test it is a test of medical capacity and political will it is a test of endurance and forbearance for believers a test of religious faith it is a test too of a different kind of faith in the strength of the ideas humans choose to help them form moral judgments and guide personal and social behavior the epidemic forces everyone to confront deep questions of human existence questions so profound that they have previously been answered in many different ways by the greatest philosophers it is a test of where all humans stand what is right and what is wrong what can individuals expect from society and what can society expect of them should others make sacrifices for me and vice versa is it just to set economic limits to fighting a deadly disease how long will we stay that way and as the epidemic grows worse and brings the disease within fewer degrees of separation for everyone we may well find that the notion of loving thy neighbor as thyself becomes far more potent at last i would like to conclude by saying that covid is something we all face as a community and thus something that we have to solve as a community not with weapons but with goodwill and common efforts blackcoffer insights adamya patel vellore institute of technology,79,prophet doom psychopath hopes

109,organizations burn a lot of resources to build one iconic image their brand is not just a picture a logo and colors but an emotional connection with the consumer it develops by making an impression on the consumers each time they interact with the products or services and it becomes ingrained in the consumers' minds now if it takes great efforts to build such impression recognition and trust why would a firm do something controversial that could burn their own hands we see hundreds of ads a day but only a few get noticed here is where a controversy comes into play we would definitely notice something that disagrees with our thoughts or mentally disturbs us so such ads stand out in controversy marketing a firm creates a controversy which gains them attention really quick and the word spreads widely they believe that in order to stand out they cannot play it safe always a controversial campaign could be about a social issue that could divide the masses stating political opinions or presenting something that does not associate with their image etc key features of a well crafted controversial campaign choosing the correct subject it could be a taboo or a debatable topic while both would be controversial a taboo is more likely to draw a flack than a debatable topic the campaign should be more focussed on the issue than on the brand itself as a result the debate would be about the issue and not the brand the campaign should always promote a respectful and healthy discussion not a fight or abuse it should present the facts and avoid over sensitising the issues no issue current situation should be exploited to a point where it becomes the tone of the firm if a controversy does not settle down early over the time it would become a part of the image of the company the firm should be always prepared with a contingency plan or a proper response in case if the campaign backfires or does not take the expected course advantages of controversial marketing increasing awareness a well crafted ad can draw the attention of the unaware audience making them explore the brands' product portfolio some of them might be potential customers shifting brand image a brand always needs to evolve as per the needs of its target audience here a controversial marketing strategy could be used to shift the image in a short span it could also define the future path for the brand emotional connect if a brand is successful in winning the heart of a consumer it half the job is done even if a controversy can divide the audience some will appreciate the message of the brand they will relate more to the brand and can become loyalists start a meaningful discussion particularly if the campaign is designed around a social issue the campaign not only becomes relevant to the company but also to the society it breaks the stigma around a topic that people frown to talk about by communicating to the masses about such a topic the company eases the air which can lead to healthy discussions boost sales the most important aspect if the brand is able to build on the sudden increase in awareness among people it could boost sales and profitability disadvantages of controversial marketing offensive in present times the audience have become highly sensitive and a controversial ad will definitely offend someone so we have to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before creating something controversial ruin brand reputation as stated earlier it puts a high risk on brand reputation for some consumers a controversy might also become a reason to not buy the product or service specifically in case of media houses if a media house gets involved in controversies often then that reduces their credibility while it can increase the awareness in a short span of time it will not work in the long run as this attention is short lived internet they say anything that goes on the internet stays on the internet due to rise of social media people have become more conscious of their choices and try to thoroughly evaluate everything as a result even one controversial campaign will not be forgotten years from now if the company tries to change their opinion on some issue then these old controversies will again come up and harm them deeply a controversial campaign can also attract legal penalties if it ends up leading to disharmony in the society examples of controversial marketing strategies movie makers frequently follow controversy as a tactic to create a buzz around their upcoming movie nike came up with “believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything ” campaign that had colin kaepernick who was outcast from nfl as he kneeled during national anthem to protest against racial inequality in nfl the ad was a huge success and nike's sales rose by the un's women's “auto complete truth” was a huge success as a campaign and garnered huge accolades from media houses here it focused on gender gap and how it was perceived that some roles could never be donned by women not all campaigns end in success zomato gathered a lot of backlash in its subtle advertising campaign where they used indian slangs in their banners put up at public places starbucks red cup campaign it created a huge buzz and boosted sales but it drove away a portion of christian customers who were offended by it in the end we can say that controversial marketing is a double edged sword on one side it benefits the firm by increasing its reach to the masses and making more people conscious about the brand on the other it puts the brand value itself at stake so it has to be carefully planned and a backup measure should always be kept ready to reduce the impact in case it backfires every such campaign should be thoroughly weighed in for the losses and benefits before execution blackcoffer insights agnivesh tripathy indian institute of management indore,61,organizations burn lot resources build iconic image brand picture logo colors emotional

mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease covid covid – covid is infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan china in december how it spreads – people can catch covid from others who have the virus the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid coughs or exhales symptoms – cough fever tiredness aches pains nasal congestion runny nose

111,as the coronavirus spreads around the world and countries implement containment measures energy supply and demand is being disrupted the impact that country wide lockdowns and demand slowdowns will have on energy markets will be evolving every day impact on energy markets are i slump in wind expansion may support german power prices the recent slump in german wind capacity is likely to continue this year as complicated regulations and weakness in the global economic outlook due to the coronavirus are likely to dampen investment in the renewable technology this has the potential to restrict future additions to wind output impacting supply and in turn supporting power prices ii chinese industrial gas demand remains weak in march chinese natural gas demand from the industrial sector in march was down by almost year on year according to the chongqing gas and petroleum exchange released over easter as the impact of the coronavirus continued to weigh on consumption iii reduced energy offtake likely to hit uk suppliers a growing number of british energy suppliers could be at risk of colllapsing through reduced energy offtake and cash flow constraints amid the coronavirus pandemic according to industry sources polled by icis iv breakdown of european power demand impact power consumption continued to soften across key european demand centres through march and the first week of april while less stringent measures and colder weather has sheltered other parts of europe v brexit set to ensure eu renewable goals while the coronavirus outbreak is already having a significant impact on the european renewables sector one unintended consequence of the pandemic is likely to be the achievement of eu and member state binding renewable energy targets for this is due to the consequences of a prolonged downturn in demand which will not be normalised for by the eu's official statistics office eurostat meaning that renewables look set to make up a higher share of consumption in across the eu vi spanish prices stay bearish but premium to france to persist spanish power prices across the curve are expected to maintain a bearish trajectory throughout the nationwide coronavirus lockdown period which was recently extended until april with further extensions possible nevertheless forecasts for below average wind generation would support spanish spot prices allowing france to continue exporting power to spain this in turn should keep spanish near curve contracts at a premium to their french equivalents vii coronavirus hits truck loaded lng demand market sources have indicated the coronavirus has reduced demand for truck loaded lng around europe as countries have implemented lockdown measures and low oil prices have made gas less competitive as a transport fuel data from terminals in northwest europe shows the impact has not been as significant as originally thought viii europe has found a coronavirus electricity demand floor electricity consumption has leveled out in germany france and italy after falling for several weeks due to restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus but in great britain and spain demand has continued to drop week on week in recent days according to an icis model that controls for the impact of temperature across europe's five largest consumers of electricity ix european power and carbon markets affected by covid – an early impact assessment in order to assess the fundamental impact of covid on european power and carbon markets we modelled a scenario in which we accounted for the first data on dropping electricity demand as well as assumed industry production cuts and continued travel restrictions x india defers on lng cargoes as lockdown ramps up india buyers are deferring lng cargoes as ports close operations with strict lockdowns in place this is a concern for sellers in a long market with india one of the key buyers xi eu to reach renewables goals on coronavirus brexit the combination of brexit and lower demand associated with the coronavirus pandemic should enable the eu as a whole as well as many member states to reach their renewable targets according to icis model run xii european power markets yet to hit coronavirus demand floor european power demand will continue to drop as governments escalate measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus electricity consumption in italy and france fell below expectations over the past seven days according to an icis model that controls for the impact of temperatures three other major power markets studied by icis – germany spain and the uk – have seen smaller drops although all are trending down xiii virus demand hit to wipe off european power prices • power demand drop likely • icis model indicates drop in demand during • price fall of across europe a scenario where power demand drops one tenth through up to june as a result of measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus would see power prices across european markets fall by an average in xiv weather driven nbp prompt upside possible in week • temperatures across nw europe to tumble in week • british local distribution zone demand to increase • eax nbp premium gaining incoming cooler weather across britain for week could encourage buying across nbp prompt and near curve contracts in the coming sessions the drop in temperatures will likely trigger a spike in heating demand which has also increased due to large numbers of people working from home to curb the spread of the coronavirus xv southeast europe braced for falling demand bankruptcies eastern european and turkish energy companies are braced for sharp drops in demand and potential bankruptcies as countries introduce emergency measures in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak although the spread of the virus is not as extensive in this region as in italy or spain the impact of the emergency measures that have been taken is likely to be felt acutely because national economies are fragile xvi europe on course for sharp reduction to power demand power sector demand across key european countries is set for a major slump over the coming weeks as countries scale up their efforts to tackle the spread of the coronavirus demand in italy which has been hit the hardest by the outbreak has dropped compared to its five year average for march during the second week of its nationwide lockdown as measures to tackle the spread of the virus intensifies across other european countries a similar drop in demand can be expected although changes are unlikely to be uniform xvii china's city gas demand steady despite coronavirus uncertain elsewhere the impact of the coronavirus in china has reduced but gas demand will still end march well down from city gate gas demand has been firm but the outlook for other sectors remains a concern xix european gas centres set for april demand destruction • eu wide demand crunch could follow after lockdowns intensify • residential demand to see brief increase before falling on warmer temperatures • lng sellers could struggle to deliver into europe xx coronavirus effects to ripple in mexico mexico's economy has perhaps never been more exposed to the global supply chains and commodity markets hit by the shocks of the coronavirus and the oil price war but its president is losing time engaging in denial and political pandering these will not help his party's election prospects if the country's economic performance falls further as its currency takes a beating amid capital flight xxi china's gas demand rebounds – satellite data emissions of nitrogen dioxide are on the rise in china this is an indication that economic activity is rising as businesses and industry ramp up activity with the coronavirus impact subsiding xxii spanish virus to impact lng imports spain is home to one third of europe's lng import capacity so a lockdown has the potential to further gum up the global lng supply chain if as seems likely it leads to a drop in demand for gas and a reduced ability to support scheduled imports xxiii european nuclear plant operators gear up to ensure power supply european nuclear power availability is expected to remain robust with strict safety measures already being implemented by the major plant operators amid the coronavirus outbreak xxiv bulgarian power

112,from alibaba to ping an and google to ford companies around the globe are telling staff to figure from directly from home in a bid to stem the spread of covid such remote functioning at scale is unprecedented and can leave a long lasting impression on the way people live and work for several years to return china which felt the primary impact of the pandemic was an early mover during this space as home to a number of the world's largest firms it offers lessons for people who are just commencing to embrace the shift working from home skyrocketed in china within the wake of the covid crisis as companies told their employees to remain home around million people were working remotely by the tip of the chinese new year holiday while this arrangement has some benefits like avoiding long commutes many employees and firms found it challenging one employee at a web company quipped his workday changed from ‘' to ‘ ' meaning from nine to nine days every week to all or any the time on the private front employees found it difficult to manage kids' home schooling via video conference while coordinating with remote colleagues at an organization level many felt that productivity rapidly tailed off if not managed properly if done right remote working can boost productivity and morale done badly it can breed inefficiency damage work relationships and demotivate employees these kind of things are happening due to the impacts of covid on the world of work here are a few of the learnings from china that will be applicable around the world looking at the circumstances designing an effective structure due to the impacts of covid on the world of work teams or whole business units working remotely can quickly end in confusion and a scarcity of clarity being isolated ends up in uncertainty about who to speak to on specific issues and the way and when to approach them resulting in hold ups and delays that is why establishing a structure and architecture for deciding and effective communication is vital here smaller cross functional teams are helpful each with a transparent mission and reporting line where directions and tasks are easy to implement this also simplifies onboarding new hires who can integrate faster in a very tight knit group at a time when the broad sweep of the organization is not visible or easy to feel with fewer in each team there is longer to urge to understand one another and build the trust that will grow more organically within the office at ping an insurance workers are typically grouped in project teams of at most members while larger business units are divided to assist them to stay agile strong company wide foundations underpin this like having a typical purpose and unified goals providing clarity on what decisions to escalate and which of them is tackled at the team level helps drive progress to mitigate the consequences of closed retail stores one leading fashion company founded a technique room and redeployed staff into four cross functional squads to support its front line it designed standard ways for live broadcasting and established internal best practices to encourage front line staff to use new retail tools to drive sales remotely the lesson putting in small cross functional teams with clear objectives and a typical purpose keeps everyone on the identical strategic course leading from afar due to impacts of covid on the world of work managing people is one of the foremost difficult elements of remote working not least because everyone will respond differently to the cultural shift and challenges of the home working environment leaders have to energize the entire company by setting a transparent direction and communicating it effectively offering a powerful vision and a sensible outlook can have a strong effect on motivation across the organization it is essential to foster an outcome driven culture that empowers and holds teams answerable for getting things done while encouraging open honest and productive communication empowering your team in this way pays dividends wesure a part of leading internet company tencent assembled a covid response team at the beginning of the year to supply amount freed from charge to front line medical workers alan lau ceo of wesure credited his team saying that they had worked nonstop many from remote locations while inactive during the chinese new year break demonstrating how responsive they were to the vision for managers the challenge is to guide inspire and direct their team in their daily course of labor while being physically remote upping the amount of interaction can even work well here one chief information officer responding to a mckinsey survey said he is texting the whole company with regular updates because it is a more human way of communicating than via the official corporate channels when working within distributed teams e commerce giant alibaba increases the frequency of its one to one communications with employees to a weekly basis and in some teams members submit a weekly report for his or her colleagues complete with plans for the week ahead alibaba's productivity app dingtalk ding ding has features inbuilt to facilitate this by allowing managers to send voice to text messages to their teams and to test in on progress the lesson determining how you communicate is simply as important as what is being said and it has to be done confidently consistently and reliably instilling a caring culture as companies transition to the new normal it is important to acknowledge that some employees are also facing other pressures reception including caring for his or her children when schools are shut resulting in feelings of isolation and insecurity business leaders must respect and address these additional needs empathy may be a crucial tool here offering how to attach promote inclusiveness and make a way of community in a very barren of physical interaction increasing social interactions within the team particularly through one on one catch up guards against feelings of isolation and demoralization and creates space for people to talk up and share their thoughts by creating a way of psychological safety for his or her colleagues being inclusive in deciding and offering perspective in challenging moments managers can stay closer to what is occurring surface issues and help their teams solve problems effectively a similar approach is very important when coping with customers and clients providing valuable stability and enabling them to navigate unknown waters confidently as an example one global bank asked their relationship managers to attach with small business customers via wechat and video calls to know their situation and help them weather the crisis to try and do so effectively at scale the managers are supported through dedicated product programs online articles scripts for communicating with clients and internal training inclusion is that the ultimate show of empathy creating outlets for sharing best practices success stories challenges and water cooler chat are significant to making a person's connection giving employees space to pursue personal or social endeavors providing a transparent span of control and assigning meaningful tasks also can spur motivation the lesson connecting on a private level and instilling empathy within the culture is doubly important when working remotely finding a new routine moving to remote working risks disrupting the office based flows and rhythms and it will be easy to hit the incorrect note or miss important virtual meetings thanks to packed schedules spend time along with your team addressing the nuts and bolts of how you will work together cover the daily rhythm individual constraints and specific norms you will decide to and anticipate what might get it wrong and the way you will mitigate it how companies plan and review their workflows has to change to reflect this the challenges of the new working pattern and of not being in one room together will be overcome by creating a digitally facilitated cadence of meetings one leading insurance firm adopted agile practices across its teams with a daily and weekly ritual of check ins sprint planning and review sessions as alibaba embraced remote working it also made sure its meetings were more tightly run one person is assigned to trace time and manage the outcomes team members can rate a meeting's usefulness by employing a five star system that gives immediate feedback and positive ways forward to address the challenge of launching a digital business with an oversized remote team one company created a replacement workflow for product requirements that clearly outlined the use of digital tools roles and responsibilities as requirements moved from ideation to validation to delivery stages reiteration of decision making structures like this is not always necessary when people can communicate directly but their absence will be keenly felt when remote working kicks in the lesson establishing robust working norms workflows and features of authority is critical but only too easy to stint on adopting a test and learn the strategy the final lesson being able to recognize what is not working and changing it fast these are the impacts of covid on the world of work leadership teams that continuously learn actively identify best practices and rapidly founded mechanisms to share ideas across the organization tend to be most successful within the future r d teams at one leading high tech manufacturer created a productivity target for remote work by estimating their productivity hebdomadally relative to onsite work and identifying levers to enhance it within four weeks they had progressed from percent to percent of their baseline as china's workforce begins to return to offices these lessons from a number of its leading companies help as an example of how—with the correct structure culture processes and technology—working remotely can boost productivity and morale employees who spend less time traveling or commuting and have a much better work life balance are likely to be happier more motivated and prepared to mobilize in extreme situations embracing remote working allows companies to define a brand new normal that drives productivity and employee satisfaction into the longer term alibaba launched taobao by now the world's biggest e commerce website while the staff was working remotely on quarantine during the sars outbreak for trip com an overseas working experiment in established the foundations for nice customer service and versatile working culture hence bringing together all the weather can enable a brand new way of working that may make your

113,when the british ruled india many indians accepted to work under their policy and they did not try to rebel against the british for their presence in indian lands they recognized the benefits of british rule what was the factor that made indians accept the british government the perception about british policies about trading pay scale and positioning in the military had been done through various marketing channels in such a way that it brainwashed people of the nation and many were ready to accept the british so the marketing is like fire when smartly handled it can destroy your enemies but when not it can burn you marketing is to design and develop a pathway from product or service to the customer through a product price place and promotion strategies marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly boiling down to vital three these are ‘what type of customer are marketing team is focusing on based on gender age location customer class w ' ‘what are product specification or applications you need to bring in front of customer w ' ‘what is your product promotion flow path w ' ‘how much time it takes to convey product information to customer h ' these criteria are what i call ‘wh' forms these basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product however are they enough no there is one more parameter called the feedback mechanism fm generally machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not the input is corrected to get the required output when it comes to human beings he she is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media tv advertising and so forth slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumer's mind in the feedback mechanism the marketing team needs to answer only one question “what kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities ” if the product image not built as per expectation then management has to review and work on wh as discussed earlier so let us elaborate how wh approach works along with feedback mechanism fig wh with fm process can target customer effectively after deciding the customer range you can work on other activities since the customer is conscious about purchasing the product and when the product promoted the first thing the customer will check is its usefulness and if his her answer is ‘yes ' then the customer will start comparing with similar alternative products in the market therefore one should present the product along with some unique thought and express the product in such a way that its image imprinted into the consumer mind for example the polio campaign in india the government had taken the initiative to make india polio free by spreading awareness through all types of social communication mediums in which television played a vital role legendary cinema actor ‘amitabh bachchan' was selected as an ambassador for this campaign initially the advertisement published in which amitabh pleaded people for vaccinating the children within a fixed schedule the advertisement circulated throughout the nation and no stone was kept unturned by the government to make this campaign successful however much to the surprise advertising failed miserably to attract a deprived community in polio booth this promotion failure was because of non consideration of the customer w and how advertise impacted its application on the customer w so after analysing failure experts recommended changes in their marketing campaign like to focus on major customer here mainly village woman who generally spend their time in home by watching tv type of impact on people people who watched tv during that era had an image of amitabh as ‘angry young man' so the campaign improved their advertising by bringing out the same angry amitabh instead of his soft image which used in the earlier campaign so in a very next polio campaign number of people in the polio booth suddenly increased and when feedback is taken from people about such a sudden change they replied that we do not want to watch ‘amitabh sir' getting angry because of us i in w organisation must focus on what kind of channel use to attract the customer currently there are a lot of platforms available by which you can market your product the main agenda you should keep in mind is that how effectively you can engage the customer through marketing at very first if you make an impact on customer then only he can show interest in your product for example changes in launching trailers of the upcoming films till th century television and newspaper were crucial factors but now along with television marketing team take help of internet resources like youtube facebook introducing an article on the pre trailer phenomenon increasing the range of promotional devices broadcast formats and publishing platforms provide a broad range to promote the film and choosing right platform may lead to a massive hit in the box office for the last factor h time the obvious question that comes to mind is that ‘is time for advertising matters ' while watching the tv when an advertisement appears many times we change the channel instead of watching the whole ad or ignore it altogether you do have an option of ‘skip ad' when you watch anything online so one must decide how much time is required to deliver product information during its promotion delivering product information in less time may create the possibility that the customer will watch it so it can result in attracting more customers so the content will be the king in the marketing however as one must have guessed it this will not work all the time other factors like the cost of the product application range type of customer can also affect the h for example the customer would be more conscious while watching higher priced product broadcast compare to the lower priced one so it would take more time for the marketing team to convince the customer to buy the expensive good than the lower priced one after implementing a marketing strategy as per wh we need to work on a feedback mechanism in which organization has to collect information about product image generated in customer's minds through dealers and using feedback form not using the feedback mechanism may lead to failure in achieving ‘product sales target' and can make the situation even worse take the example of ‘the tata nano making of world's cheapest car ' which was mind blowing one of a kind projects in indian automobile industry from the first phase of a marketing campaign tata nano was on so much continuous limelight that this project was pleased by former american president barack obama ii the curiosity about the product was so high that the sale of then leading car model maruti was dropped by immediately after unveiling the nano iii however while marketing the product an organization built “affordable garibo ki car” image in customer's mind which made customers conscious about what will be their status quo in society after buying nano thus they started giving preference to two wheelers over nano during the same time some instances of nanos catching fire came into focus which worsened the situation this case even exacerbates when the team did not work on the feedback mechanism and hence was not able to change customer perception about nano later when nano fire problem was technically sorted out but even then the marketing team did not make any impactful effort to market the improved safety of the car therefore customer's negative perception remained stuck and the organization did not even come close to achieving selling figures of nano if the organization had used feedback mechanism it would have been an entirely different story so wh can be an essential factor while developing a marketing strategy for the product along with a reversible fm method this method can help us to monitor product marketing throughout the phases and can help the marketing team to change strategy whenever it goes into the wrong path i ii iii,64,british ruled india indians accepted work policy rebel british presence indian lands recognized benefits british rule factor

114,the business of business is no longer to do just business or increase the bottom line to maximize shareholder value rather the concept of business is moving towards a new dimension of sustainable business the triple bottom line people planet and profits are the core ideologies that are rooted in sustainable business sustainability is taken into account when companies want to create long term value creation along with strategies that promote the longevity of the company as corporate accountability rises expectations and need for transparency among stakeholders increases therefore companies have started to recognize the need to be sustainable to stay alert and alive business globalization that has happened over the previous few decades has made some companies more powerful than some national governments making it easy for them to exploit inexpensive labor plunder natural resources causing severe impacts through pollution on the natural environment human health and biodiversity unfortunately for them their horrible past has been catching up with them like in the case of child labor issues of ikea nike rana plaza accident in bangladesh affecting zara h m and other clothing brands environment pollution by bp shell exxon mobil etc with the emergence of internet and social media these practices can no longer be covered up and silenced the world has become more educated and less tolerant and therefore with every misdemeanor that is committed brand equity takes a hit the media is fast picking up on cover ups half truths and bad corporate behavior and demanding accountability and transparency from corporates therefore to survive companies are compelled to adopt sustainability and bring forth the rules for their suppliers as well many of the irresponsible company practices and disasters that are witnessed in that last couple of decades were motivated solely by short termism the desire for instant gratification and the appeal of short term performance incentives for instance deferred maintenance and slack leadership were to blame for the leaks from the pesticide plant union carbide india ltd in bhopal estimates placed more than half a million casualties from the gas discharge of the plant finally union carbide corporation's litigation payout came out to today's equivalent of nearly one billion us dollars another example where the company was forced to shut down operations was coca cola at its plachimada plant in kerala the local communities faced acute water shortage after the commissioning of the plant and the company authorities blatantly ignored the community woes these businesses stated above did not respect stakeholder engagement which ultimately lead to their untimely demise today's issues cannot be solved without participation from all stakeholders and companies with influence should be the torchbearers of change they need to engage with regulators communities societies suppliers and ngos for effective and desired outcomes issues where engagement are required include population growth global middle class growth decline in ecosystems water scarcity food safety material resource security higher global energy demand changes in geographic patterns of energy consumption and increasing climate change regulatory interventions by actively pursuing the triple bottom line the essential possibilities available are save expenses by reducing environmental effects motivate employees and decreased employee turnover decrease risk through engaging with stakeholders create a reputation by improving environmental effectiveness in order for companies to commit to sustainability they should have the below objectives in place strategy alignment and sustainability management should ensure alignment between the company's strategy and its sustainability initiatives sometimes there is a divergence between the two concepts making sustainability attempts to look fragile and lacking real dedication and prioritization for example toyota is well known for hybrid engine development but less so for decreasing its reliance on rare earth minerals toyota decreased its dependence on imports and operational risk thus reducing its economic hazards in the event of price rises compliance first then competitive advantage compliance must be addressed first and foremost by businesses which often involves laws on waste management pollution and energy efficiency as well as human rights and labor accountability recent reports show that investors are shying away from compliance hazards progressively reactive to proactive as a result of a crisis many of today's leading sustainability businesses such as nike coca cola telenor ikea siemens and nestlé have stepped up mainly for instance in locations like indonesia throughout the s nike confronted boycotts and government anger for abusive labor practices but turned the tide around it became a pioneer in the establishment of transparency in by releasing a full list of the factories with which it contracts and a comprehensive page report revealing conditions and payment in its factories it also recognized huge problems especially in its factories in south asia these businesses have all created more proactive sustainability approaches by acknowledging the effect of sustainability in a crisis quantify including the company situation all businesses are struggling to quantify their sustainability investment returns this is a straightforward problem with respect to compliance transparency is a precondition for assessing and enhancing sustainability practices the only way for companies to achieve transparency is through open communication with all key stakeholders based on high levels of information

120,before jumping to the pros and cons of industrial revolution it is important to understand industrial revolution industrial revolution industrial revolution is the term that is used to describe the transition from an electronic based industry to the one that is dominated by the fusion of new and emerging fields and ideas like artificial intelligence robotics and green energy etc ‘industry ' is the era of digitalization the term originated from hanover messe and was incorporated in german high tech strategy much is attributed to klaus schwab a german engineer who founded the world economic forum two years later the industry platform central network for digital transformation was set up to make it work it is characterized by physical and digital trends autonomous motor vehicles cars trucks drones aircraft water vessels d printing medical implants advanced robotics agri to health care new materials graphene benefits some of the benefits are as follows it helps relieve poverty and improve people standard of living with artificial intelligence and fast paced internet like g there will be better diagnosis cheaper and better medical services the emergency of new and innovative technologies helps better undertake better security surveillance and search and rescue operations india has currently announced a new drone policy that allows for efficient security traffic and mapping it will help connect every last village in the country to ensure better government services and improved infrastructure for all artificial intelligence will play a significant role in changing the lives of specially abled able it promotes ease of doing business and ease of living the improved early warning systems weather forecasting systems etc and assure improved disaster management reduce of causality faster evacuations the improvement in fields of biotechnology ai pest control mechanism innovative irrigation system etc allows for increased crop production pros and cons of industrial revolution pros cons industry helps us to improve operational performance and efficiency with minimum machine downtimes we can produce more and faster while allocating resources more cost effectively and efficiently data security issues are one of the main concerns for the manufacturers as they believe investing in smart factories may increase the risk of security breaches and the chance of proprietary production knowledge theft since most of the production processes are automated high quality standards can be maintained at a lower manufacturing cost technical glitches loss of high paying jobs and resistance from stakeholders to invest in new technologies are few entry level barriers towards industry it can also enhance flexibility speed to market and agility for launching new products and services it is easier to scale production up or down in a smart factory with minimum modifications social issues and their impact on society are a few of the notable cons earlier industrial revolutions as they went through made huge changes in social terms there was a lot of urbanization and industrialization there is uncertainty as to how things will shape up now industry presents an opportunity to improve customer experience and service by reducing resolution time fewer defects and offers more product choices to the customers interoperability information transparency automation and integration of the production process are a few critical changes lying ahead for all the existing manufacturers it makes compliance easier – complying with regulations in industries like pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing does not have to be a manual process instead industry technologies make it possible to automate compliance including track and trace quality

121,india is on the verge of an unprecedented economic as well as humanitarian disaster from covid india is facing economic pressure due to the coronavirus outbreak this outbreak has resulted in a steep slowdown in the indian economy whereby india's gdp has reduced by as seen by current statistics with covid being into the picture the indian economy is going through a severe slowdown and on top of that multiple such problems hitting the world of work from many such directions companies and industries are finding it difficult to sustain in such an environment of the financial crisis industries are being urged to take up certain tough decisions like layoff retrenchment compulsive leave without pay and many alternative cost effective methods to sustain the present economic crisis like cutting down the salaries handing over the pink slip to employees and opting best possible the sudden outbreak has presented new roadblocks for the indian workforce and especially for the daily wage and contractual workers according to the latest economy forecast by the un the probability of countries entering into the recession and companies going bankrupt has increased and india is not likely to “remain decoupled” from the global meltdown lockdown across the country is causing significant disruption across multiple sectors including manufacturing tourism aviation real estate etc are the worst affected temporary lockdown resulting in the closing of shopping malls has affected the indian economy in a disastrous manner adversely as a result of which consumption of essential items has reduced which in turn has given a terrible blow to the retail sector according to the statistics from the economic times of india live event industries have seen an estimated loss of ₹ crores a number of young startups have been affected as the funding has fallen and there would be a lack of investors in the market the disruption of the economy is much starker and alarming than the global financial crisis of which hit the indian financial sector besides that back in the indian economy was much better placed to handle the crisis according to the data in the gst collection was expected to be approximately lakh crore while the government was only able to collect a total of lakh crore that is a total loss of lakh crore the government also faced a setback in the income tax sector as the expected revenue to be collected was estimated to lakh crore but the government faced a shortfall of crores the above discrepancies have resulted in insufficient funds with the government clearly the government does not have sufficient funds to provide relief to the people mainly the labor class contractual workers and the people working on the basis of daily wages other major industries whose figures of losses are alarming are the hospitality and tourism industry which employs approx crore people in the next months it expects lakh job losses which may act as a major factor in revenue lo and revenue losses of ₹ crores the aviation industry is worth ₹ lakh crore employing lakh people they expect a revenue loss of ₹ crores just between april and june india's retail industry is the total worth of ₹ lakh crore employing around crore people if the pandemic crisis lasts months further it expects crore job losses the restaurant industry employs people of whom may probably lose their job the real estate industry is looking at an approximate job loss ride hailing industries meaning ola and uber have approximately million driver partners the crisis has led to a drop of in the business these figures would get even more disturbing in the next few weeks as the country heads into total lockdown top car manufacturers like honda hyundai have shut down their car productions many other such companies have shut down their production until further notice this would again lead to more lay offs the stock market in india has also seen a breakdown since the lockdown quarantine and lockdowns have disrupted the chain supply across the whole world as the trade between the countries has come to a halt it has affected the global economy as well as the country's gdp while some industries in india depend on other countries for their raw material for example the electronics market it depends on china majorly for its raw material has seen a major setback as trade between the two countries trade has been seized the outbreak of the virus has placed tremendous responsibility in the hands of the government the reserve bank of india rbi along with the government intends to implement below mentioned measures to deal with the looming economic crisis such as the government under their “jan dhan yojana” has opened crore bank accounts that aim to make affordable access to financial services for the poorest population of india even a direct transfer ₹ can reduce the distress of the poor immediately interest free or low interest bank loans must be provided for medium small and micro enterprises for the next months which could give an immediate boost for the economy lowering tax to stimulate demand and place more money in the hands of the people and businesses is

122,the corona outbreak has hit us hard with the world economy suddenly coming to a standstill the future seems more uncertain the pandemic has shown its worst effect in the developed countries most the following figure depicts the most affected countries as of march source who however the cases in india are still low with total active cases under as of st april but the low number of tests performed remains a big issue of concern the following map shows the affected states in india – source ministry of health and family welfare the number may seem small but if we closely have a look at the daily cases reported then the situation seems more alarming with the growth looking more of exponential now the number of cases no doubt are soon going to increase in the future which is hard to predict right now but the curve is expected to be flatter in case of india as the lesson has been learnt from mistakes of countries like italy and a nation has been kept under a lockdown this was a necessary step no doubt but it has raised more problems for an already slowdown hit country the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry ficci said “a significant percent of indian businesses indicate the marked impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business operations even at early stages ” the tourism and travel industry has been hit most whose operations have almost come down to zero the second most hit sector is manufacturing and with a significant portion of the unorganized sector being employed there the situation worsens healthcare and hygiene products like mouth masks sanitizers and handwash have become expensive due to excessive demand with the present ongoing situation the followings things can be predicted the medicines and healthcare costs are expected to increase in the future as india imports of the raw material of pharmaceutical drugs and due to lockdown in both countries the supply route has been fragmented drastically this is also evident with the recent increase in common use medicines like paracetamol whose cost has gone up by as per the latest crisil report industries depending on cheap labor could take a hit as such pandemics are more prone to populated countries and the factory workers and unorganized sectors do not have access to healthcare benefits so the cases might just shoot up drastically and their attendance in the future will go down in the same rate inversely smartphones and electronics sales will be affected directly in china the sale of smartphones is expected to go down by as stores are in lockdown for a long time new launch events are getting postponed or canceled and since china is the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world with out of every smartphones shipped from china this will affect us too similar is the case with electronics whose parts and even whole units in many cases are manufactured by china so their prices might rise in the future maybe not immediately but in the last quarter of the financial year lack of technology will incur a greater logistic cost of containing the coronavirus outbreaks in the case of india china being the technology giant took the help of technology to track and contain the coronavirus outbreak but in our case where more than of transactions are by hand the cost and risk of containing the virus will be very high the meat prices are dropping drastically due to stigma with losses reaching more than crores this is an issue of serious concern for a country like india whose meat industry is governed by the unorganized sector the sectors which are going to get some serious hit are airlines tourism travel cruise share market leisure hospitality automobiles and product manufacturers due to negative sentiments and fear in the minds of common people the sectors which will need to prove themselves are banking education healthcare and manufacturing a lot will depend on how they will react in the future the indian economy could react to corona crisis in ways v shaped this is “classic” real economy shock where output does get displaced but growth eventually recovers in this scenario annual growth rates could fully absorb the shock this was the case with the canada post crisis where canada maintained the credit flow and capital formation u shaped this scenario is worse than v— the shock persists and even though the initial growth is resumed but there is some permanent loss of output this was the case with the usa post crisis this was led by a deep banking crisis that disturbed credit supply l shaped this scenario is worst of all not only the growth rate declines but the economy never recovers the distance between the previous and new path keeps on widening with increased loss of output leaving lasting structural damage to the economy with

124,what is coronavirus is it a disease how it is spread to humans how coronavirus affects the world economy several questions come in mind when we talk about the coronavirus coronavirus disease covid is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus these are a type of virus that creates sickness in humans there are many different kinds and some cause disease a newly identified type has caused a recent outbreak of respiratory illness now called covid the covid virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes coronaviruses vary significantly in the risk factors some can kill more than of those infected and some are relatively harmless such as the common cold coronaviruses cause colds with major symptoms such as fever and a sore throat from swollen adenoids occurring primarily in the winter and early spring seasons as it creates much chaos between humans and also affected the whole human diversity it also creates a disturbance in the economy the economy is the largest system of trade and industry by which the wealth of a country is made and used if this economy will not work then the human race will also come to an end so not only covid makes the humans sick but also it makes the economy a viral whole the impact of coronavirus firstly affects economic growth which is the factor that creates nation wealth economic growth creates wealth on a national scale for the government in the form of taxation which is then redistributed accordingly to the services and communities that need it the most due to covid industrial production sales and investment all fell in the first two months of the year which decline the whole economic growth such a slowdown in manufacturing industries has hurt countries that are interlinked to each other in terms of exports i e asia pacific economies sub saharan economies and the usa economies a reduction in global economic activity has lowered the demand for oil taking oil prices to multi year lows this happens even before a disagreement on production cuts between opec and its allies caused the plunge in oil prices job creation and employment opportunities are the second most factor which was affected by coronavirus as it often requires the skills and some wilful hands which necessitate in the long term of the business longer lasting and more intensive outbreak have half growth the opportunities in as factories suspend their activity and workers stay at home to try to avoid the virus poverty is the third and most important factor which is diversely affected by covid as employment is not there and everyone was ordered to stay at home when people will be in their own houses then automatically poverty will increase complimenting the decrease in economic growth there is also a big shift in stock markets where shares in companies are bought and sold affected many investments by the investors and shareholders or individual savings accounts central banks in many countries including india have slashed interest rates supermarkets and online delivery services also have huge growth in demand as customers stockpile goods such as hand sanitizers toilet paper rice and orange juice etc as the pandemic escalates at last the covid normally called coronavirus affects the world economy in a much disintegrated manner some economies in which there are many deaths due to coronavirus will take more time to recover as their economy has gone before years back the economy can only be revived if the government makes more

125,the generally accepted solution to economies stagnating under inefficient and resource sapping state run monopolies is liberalization china under the leadership of deng xiaoping did it in after witnessing their economic growth falter and surpassed by their asian rivals japan and south korea india did the same in after being backed into a corner by the balance of payments crisis the telecom industry in india was one of the many sectors subject to reform and the privatization of this industry meant that the total number of subscribers shot up from million in the year to over billion subscribers in this also allowed reliance jio in to disrupt the industry by initiating a price war which led to a significant decrease in mobile usage tariffs and large scale consolidation of telecom giants the benefits of which the consumers are reaping the stability of this approach in the long term is still under question however it cannot be denied that this change has brought access to unprecedented amounts of data to people for whom it was impossible to get without a significant financial outlay in a country where despite having close to of the world population at the start of the millennium its global share in the life insurance market was only a similar change was necessary for bringing insurance coverage to the most vulnerable and underrepresented sections of society the insurance market was opened up in august by the then recently formed insurance regulatory and development authority irdai and years on there has been a noticeable change according to a research publication by swiss re life insurance penetration which is the ratio of total life insurance premium underwritten to the gdp of the country has come up from in to in hitting a peak of in the drop in insurance penetration is attributed to lesser consumer spending in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and not a systemic issue with the indian insurance market life insurance density or life insurance is underwritten per capita has increased six times from usd in to usd in however the global average insurance penetration rate including both life and non life insurance stands at compared to india's some of our asian neighbors such as thailand china and malaysia to have outdone us in this regard their insurance density is also far superior the figures for malaysia thailand and china during the same period i e were usd usd and usd respectively compared to usd for india like india these countries have an open insurance market where foreign firms are allowed to enter and impart funds and technological expertise however the challenges and nuances that are involved in ensuring greater coverage and access to information for indian citizens are far different than the ones there as of only of the indian population had access to the internet compared to and for malaysia china and thailand respectively this made them better equipped to fully utilize technological innovations in the insurance sector compared to india however with the increasing availability of smartphones reduced internet tariffs and fast adoption of digital technology the number of internet users in india stood at million in according to the telecom regulatory authority of india trai annual report which is roughly of the total population the telecom ministry expects the number to reach million by the key here is to be well poised to take full advantage of rapid internet availability to boost further penetration in the indian insurance sector and encourage further innovation and liberalization a lot of emphasis on insurance technology now is laid on big data machine learning and artificial intelligence policybazaar which began as a website for simply comparing insurance policy prices has now

that data to adequately price premiums for life insurance these developments indicate a clear shift towards the greater adoption of new technologies in the insurance sector the huge potential that

126,disruption in fintech – the lightning network blockchain or the distributed ledger technology has already been around for some time now cryptocurrencies like bitcoin based on the blockchain technology are making entry into the formal finance world and increasingly becoming a medium for exchange though there are many potential use cases for cryptocurrencies and the indian government is very critical about implementing the technology in banking and finance it still has a lot of issues to be resolved before we can commercially use it for transactions some of the most important drawbacks of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin right now are as below scalability bitcoin can have transactions per second as compared to via payment network giants like visa there is a block limit of mb which amounts to gbs per min on a bitcoin block to match transactions per second this essentially means that home computers cannot process this currently and it has very limited use cases with transactions requiring devices having the high computational power centralization high computation power requirement would limit the usage of the network to only those who can afford it this will eventually lead to fewer validations for the distributed ledger defeating the whole purpose of using blockchain a distributed ledger means that everyone in the network can validate the transaction between two parties so it becomes important to have a cheaply available validation mechanism that can be carried out using a basic broadband connection in home small business computers if two people have personal transaction history it is unimportant that it should be posted on the main blockchain every time a transaction takes place as it could bloat up the blockchain moreover everyday transactions using cryptocurrency is not possible as the cost of posting a transaction for let us say buying a coffee can be more than the price of coffee itself introducing the lightning network lightning network is the latest disruptive technology being researched currently in fintech to make cryptocurrencies scalable it basically adds an extra layer on top of the main bitcoin blockchain and enables payment channels between two parties over this layer micropayments for everyday transactions can be very easily carried out using this channel here is how it works suppose a buys a coffee from the nearby coffee shop b daily on her way to work a and b decide to open a channel on the blockchain for their everyday transactions once the channel or the lightning network is open the two parties can keep a track of their daily transactions on this ledger at the end of the month with the ledger reflecting balances left with each party they decide to close the channel this final transaction is then recorded on the main bitcoin blockchain this reduces the cost of the transaction and enables micropayments for everyday transactions micropayment channels can defer updating the main blockchain with remaining balances at a later date a large network of micropayments can be created as a secondary layer on top of the main blockchain to address the scalability issue and reduce transaction fees although this solution is very much in the initial stages resolving the scalability issue and reducing transaction fees by taking the transaction out of the main blockchain will give a big boost to the use of cryptocurrencies how do payments take place on the lightning network the two parties exchange a single key for validation of their spend transactions they can conduct an unlimited number of transactions on this channel and finally when one party closes the channel the balances will be added to the blockchain each user can open a digital wallet to store bitcoins and deposit some coins in it once the channel is opened this money is kind of a security deposit on behalf of both the parties to honor their transaction once they need to exchange money after their books are updated they can sign off the ledger in the channel finally this will be added to the blockchain once the channel is closed the network is globally scalable since to reach any person through connected channels network you just need to know the path to connect to that person through leveraging your existing network once the network develops in future the requirement to open a separate channel too would cease to exist since the algorithm will automatically find the shortest route to connect to the person whom you want to pay based on the exhaustive peer to peer network this would ease inter country transactions and money can be sent across internationally within seconds limitations of the technology – since the channel for lightning network is separate and not connected with the main blockchain

its dependency on the internet the lightning network is not capable of storing coins digitally in a hardware wallet this makes it prone to hackers since the wallet will be available online also

129,quality and affordable healthcare is a vision of all governments across the globe the high cost of medical service and lack of sufficient infrastructure is detrimental to this vision in developed countries such as the u s reducing healthcare cost is an agenda point of all the politicians even in india affordable healthcare will be as important as “roti kapda and makan” in the near future technology can play a big role in reducing healthcare cost and making it more efficient the vast quantity of data is available with hospitals and insurance providers big data can play a big role in analyzing this data to produce actionable insight some of the benefits of using big data are as follows reduce fraud and waste fraud has a big impact on everyone in fact the national healthcare anti fraud association estimates that fraud costs americans at least billion to billion annually – that is approximately of the nation's health care spending of trillion for example sometimes providers or hospitals report procedures or services that were never provided big data analytics can help an insurance company to discover these frauds big data can use a huge amount of historical data to identify expected procedure or service for reported illness identified using diagnosis code if the expected procedure code does not match with a billed procedure code insurance companies can tag claim as a potential fraud claim once a claim is tagged as a fraud claim the manual examiner needs to do additional verification to ensure that the claim is submitted by fraud provider sometimes patients' fake identity to get the benefit of insurance using big data companies can match patients' information with services he she has taken if services taken by the patient is very different from the past medical history of patients analytics can tag claim as one of the susceptible fraud claims storing of data traditional health care providers find it difficult to store a vast amount of data more ever traditional database stores only structured data big data can solve storage issue by handling huge volume and variety of data having historical data of the patient can reduce healthcare drastically improving scheduling of appointments it is very tough to get a physician's appointment in developed countries one of my friends senior director in a multinational bank got an appointment for hip replacement surgery with a waiting period of six months he was not able to sit and as a result he did not drive or come to the office for six months the waiting period can be drastically reduced if the hospital is able to forecast the number of patients likely to miss appointments based on historical data hospitals can predict the number of no shows and can accordingly schedule appointments so as not to miss any slot because of no shows reducing overpayment and underpayment made to hospital if a health insurance company pays an amount to hospital provider that is greater than the contracted amount for service payment is called an overpayment similarly if payment made is lesser than the contracted amount for service payment is called an underpayment overpayment or underpayment is a big headache for both insurance companies and patients according to aha data private insurance companies have consistently overpaid hospitals for inpatient care for more than three decades these overpayments have varied significantly over the years but have grown dramatically in the past few years overpayment or underpayment can happen because of multiple reasons such as system glitch a coding error using cognitive analysis big data can predict the payment amount if the predicted payment amount is significantly different than the actual payment amount the system can identify possible overpayments or underpayments predictive treatment throughout the world healthcare is based on diagnosing the presence of disease and subsequently treating the disease if present early diagnosis of the illness is a major challenge patients do go for diagnosis only when the symptom is evident it becomes challenging for the physician to treat illness once illness grows beyond a certain level predictive or preventive can help to identify if an individual will develop a disease different forms of health device such as iwatch can capture data and send to the hospital at regular interval of time using predictive analysis the hospital can predict if a patient is likely to develop an illness early diagnosis of illness can help doctors to treat patients effectively and at a lower cost predictive treatment can reduce the number of days a patient needs to be admitted in the hospital as inpatient treatment is costlier than outpatient treatment doctors can discharge patients if he she thinks that the condition of the patient is not serious the hospital can monitor the patient remotely using medical sensors and can call the patient to the hospital when it is required big data plays a big role when a person suffers from multiple illnesses as per dr abhishek rai m s ortho of k e m medical college mumbai “it becomes challenging to operate patients when he suffers from multiple illnesses many a number of times physicians are not aware of all issues with patients as patients themselves are not aware of all illness” as an example it is tough to operate on a person suffering from diabetes as blood does not coat easily for a diabetic person if a physician does not have historical data of a diabetic person he she may operate diabetic person wrongly another example where big data analytics can play a huge role in predicting disease is a genetic disease if a person has breast cancer her child is percent likely to develop breast cancer using big data analytics the system can identify patients likely to suffer from genetic disease and request patients to do timely screening genetic diseases can be screened in first second or third degree relatives to reduce the morbidity and mortality timely diagnostic reports in india it takes days on an average to get an mri scan delay is not because of lack of medical instruments but because of lack of qualified radiologists this problem can be mitigated by integrating medical imaging with big data integration of medical imaging with big data will ensure that radiologists get the report in a short span of time big data will help not only to reduce the turnaround time required to get reports but also to get better reports technology can convert image to graphs and charts making it easier for radiologists to read the report as data works on the principle of abundance instead of scarcity so the more data we have the better the outcomes can be obtained thus big data technology is clearly the digital disruptor to revolutionize the healthcare sector by consolidating the data from disparate platforms to build a degree view about the human body and help the healthcare provider to generate

130,analytics is a statistical scientific process of discovering and presenting the meaningful patterns that can be found in data while business analytics refers to the skills technologies applications practices computer programming and operations research for the continuous exploration of data to gain insight that drives business decisions business analytics technology is helping healthcare organizations regulate existing data to improve clinical and business operations in addition to this analytics help to identify the symptoms of diseases in preliminary stages itself along with suggesting possible remedies for the same without any need of the intervention of a human being with the help of analytics and chatbots patient can now look for expert doctor advice in the comfort of their home free of charge in most of the cases with as easy accessibility as one touch from your smartphones according to the survey conducted by health catalyst a whopping of the respondents admitted that analytics is going to be either “extremely important” or “very important” to their organization within the next few years and the respondents also rated the importance of healthcare trends and the role played by analytics in them analytics is thus becoming very crucial in tracking different types of healthcare trends advanced analytics touches every aspect of healthcare software systems including clinical operational and financial sectors the role of analytics in transforming healthcare healthcare organizations have begun to adopt technologies like pacs imaging systems and emrs or electronic health records that attempts to make sense of the massive data that flows through the system both structured and unstructured hence it is important to know what are the tools that can extract information from the data to generate value and enjoy operational financial and clinical insights there are genome analyzers and other analytics tools in the market that help in understanding the facts and eliminate unwanted useless details to extract only what is needed the end result of this is better clinical outcomes for the patient there are several ways in which healthcare organizations can make use of information collected through various sources disease surveillance and preventative management develop clinically relevant and more effective diagnostic and therapeutic techniques development of a faster leaner and more productive r d pipeline examples of business intelligence in healthcare the following examples indicate successful applications built on a foundation of advanced analytical capabilities in the healthcare industry unitypoint health in iowa managed to reduce their risk adjusted readmission rate by over the course of three years in one of their pilot hospitals by utilizing predictive modeling via business intelligence software washington state health care authority reduced unnecessary er visits by implementing a business intelligence for the healthcare system to electronically integrate and distribute patient data across er departments hospitals were able to identify patients who visited more frequently than others and share that patient's information with other hospitals this resulted in an overall reduction of frequent er visits by a decrease in visits by frequent er patients by and scheduled prescription allocation

131,big data to begin with i shall first like to explain what big data is and why it has become so important in our lives big data is simply data but with a huge size data that is not just voluminous but also growing exponentially with time such data sets are so large and complex that it is not possible to store or process them using traditional data management tools so how huge can this data be social media sites like facebook generate more than terabytes of new data every day in the form of photos video uploads text messages etc a single jet engine can generate more than terabytes of data in minutes of flight time with many thousand flights per day generation of data reaches up to many petabytes data contained in these sets are not always structured it can be semi structured or even unstructured when such is the size and dimension of data we can well imagine how complicated it must be to process and analyze it therefore modern methods of data analysis are being developed and used to process the information contained in big data sets opportunities now coming to the opportunities that big data provides they are not just limited to healthcare big data analysis is now a disruptive technology which has intervened into numerous fields and proved its worth healthcare is no exception big data has the potential to change the entire dynamics of the healthcare industry and improve the quality of life of people healthcare industry is a very large and complicated system it involves a lot of risks and always demands better care however when a large number of patients seek emergency care the complications as well as the cost rise exponentially in india many times we even lack sufficient infrastructure to support the patients there is a deficit of beds as well as doctors to provide treatment to the patients for instance when epidemics break out and lives are lost at a very alarming rate we can easily gauge our helplessness however the scenario is certainly improving now with the advent of digitization into the healthcare system healthcare providers or practitioners are now having access to a huge amount of patient health data this healthcare big data can be processed and analyzed to identify patient patterns more quickly and effectively the information obtained can be extremely useful to figure out chronic health issues and provide preventive treatment plans well beforehand so as to curb that disease or disorder from occurring this method is also known as predictive analysis and it is one of the most crucial benefits of big data in healthcare this technology can help the healthcare industry in more ways than we can infer healthcare organizations that have implemented predictive analysis have witnessed a reduction in er visits by providing support and care to patients and decreasing emergency situations apart from reduced er visits and timely treatment there are many other benefits of big data and predictive analysis patients with high risk life threatening issues can be provided with more customized treatment facilities due to lack of data there exists a lack of proper planning in hospitals under or over booking of staff lack of medical equipment medicines and other facilities are a result of inefficient budgeting and ill management of finances using predictive analysis these problems can be solved which will lead to reduced costs and efficient management of finances better staff allocation and admission rate prediction shall facilitate improvement in daily operations of healthcare organizations by using big data the effect of recency bias could be reduced as well when we give more importance to recent events and tend to ignore the effect of the older ones it may lead to incorrect decisions this is known as recency bias big data also helps in preventing fraudulent activities which in turn prevents losses of insurance companies challenges while all of this is changing the healthcare industry for the better it is not that easy to reap the benefits of big data there are a whole lot of challenges and vulnerabilities attached to its implementation one of the biggest challenges is security healthcare big data contains the personal information and health history of patients acts of hacking cyber theft and phishing pose a serious threat to these databases such data could be stolen and sold for huge sums of money protection of the patients' privacy hence is a serious challenge to big data implementation also the data would contain external data apart from medical information the organization therefore has to take care of privacy legal compliances and government policies privacy and security of patients have to be given utmost importance and no breach of any kind can be permitted the next challenge is data classification and modeling the size of the data is massive and it is less structured and heterogeneous classifying such massive data to identify relevant information is a big challenge modeling of such unstructured data is equally difficult storage and retrieval is another major challenge huge cloud servers with sufficient space are required to store such voluminous data also the speed should be high so that uploading of data can be done hassle free the way storage is a challenge retrieval also is a matter of concern integrating the data and getting all relevant systems to link each other is a tough job the next challenge is a major one in my opinion finding the right talent who own the expertise to implement this modern technology is an arduous task shortage of required talent is a crisis in the market today even after hiring the right talent it is a challenge to retain them scarce resources like data scientists are hard to find and even harder to retain they are easily poached by competitors a good and efficient compensation strategy conducive work environment high incentives opportunities for career growth and development can be some of the ways of retaining such intellectual talent in a nutshell we can conclude that while big data is a disruptive technology which will bring about landmark changes in healthcare dynamics the challenges and vulnerabilities need to be addressed with the utmost care and sense of responsibility blackcoffer insights subhasmita dey xavier school of human resource management xub,65,big data begin explain big data important lives

132,“sometimes the illness just sits in the body waiting for the right time to bloom ” he remarked bob was a consultant globe trotting for days a week and this had finally taken a toll on his health as he sat recuperating in his plush hospital room miles away from his home in new york gazing out of the window he suddenly remembered jacob – his physician back home – calling him up at work a few days ago and warning him to take sufficient rest to control his stress levels as his heartbeat had started showing some irregularities jacob had been remotely monitoring bob's cardiac information since his cardiac arrest years ago and was able to guide bob with his medication doses and diet based on real time data “should have realized jacob was not crying wolf when he predicted something might go wrong” bob was in a conference when he felt a shooting pain in his hand and he knew he was having another cardiac arrest but before he could alert anybody his vision blurred and he fell to the ground ray who was at the conference rushed to bob and reached for his wallet to find his health information card that carried his unique patient identity upi details every second counted as bob's breathing slowed and as the sirens blared into his ears ray could see the paramedics jump out of the ambulance with complete charts of bob's previous medical records that were available against the upi ray had provided as ray climbed into the ambulance he saw that the paramedics had started the preliminary round of treatment based on the real time vital stats past medical history and inputs from a cardiologist who was remotely monitoring the situation from the hospital bob was safe this is what technology can achieve empowering every healthcare provider to make the best efforts to save lives backed by powerful insights from data this story could have been a tale in the present but it is not so with such huge volumes of data being generated at every step in the healthcare value chain and enough advances in technology to explore varied data what is stopping us from using technology and being data driven in healthcare today for any industry to be data driven the main element of decision making is – you guessed it right “data” and this is exactly where the problem lies for a data driven approach to making complex decisions it is imperative to collect relevant high quality consistent and reliable data that can be utilized to derive useful insights and predict future outcomes with high accuracy thus if healthcare needs to fully exploit data and analytics it needs to develop three strong capabilities – integration of data from multiple sources capability to build and develop advanced analytical models with lower error margins and the ability to transform the organization into a breeding ground for deep insights and predictive prognosis with the right mindset inclined to adopting transformation so that the analytical models drive results data collection and integration finding the right data is the major challenge in any analytics project and more so in healthcare the major reason being low adoption rates of digital data capturing methods and high data fragmentation a low adoption of digital practices means that healthcare providers still rely on manual modes of data entry like notes or oral recommendations to convey a patient's medical information despite being one of the most technologically advanced countries the electronic health records ehr adoption rate is only as of the end of may this is dismal state and analytics based on such limited information is not a good representation of the actual population in developing countries the percentages are more disappointing with low digitized data available and lesser interoperability electronic medical records emr is more prevalent than ehr which means if bob visited any health provider apart from jacob there are high chances his medical records are not available bob wears a fitbit that tracks his activity levels and sleep pattern details he also uses the myfitnesspal app on his mobile to keep a check on his calorie intake he is a regular social media user and often posts about his day on the platforms b with the growth in technologies like remote monitoring wearables social media analytics etc bob as a patient is generating a lot of real time data from his wearable devices and apps his social media interactions can be analyzed using text analytics to explore and predict any mental health issues these can be considered as one major source of data for analytics clinical data like ehr and emr monthly yearly credit card transactions used to make medical payments medical claim settlements genetic databases public records are major sources of data for analytics this makes the data sources too fragmented and difficult to work on due to dissimilar syntaxes fragmented database seldom leads to standardized good quality data also every organization has a different goal to achieve with the data it collects and hence the nature of data captured by each is different c bob had a upi that made it easy for the paramedics to serve him to the best of his interest and do all this in the least turnaround time no upi or any unique identifier for the patient makes it difficult to integrate patient data from different sources countries like australia canada france new zealand norway sweden and the u k which have advanced on their ehr capabilities to achieve almost a adoption rate with high interoperability have done so by employing upis organization mindset jacob faced a lot of resistance from the nurses in his clinic when he announced the introduction of cpoe and ehr machines for entry of data the nurses earlier used to manually write patient information and now felt threatened as the machines had taken over the jobs resistance to the adoption of technology due to job reduction impacts skill gap to adopt to technology leading to higher costs on training with huge volumes of data being generated the threat from security standpoint needs to be addressed since healthcare entails a lot of sensitive information about the patient there is a heightened risk of thefts that can paramount to identity theft from to the number of individuals affected by protected health information breaches increased from approximately million to approximately million in the us alone without a data governance structure in place patients would fear and shun providers implementing e entry of data healthcare providers can be reluctant to set up standard data that promote data interoperability as standardization of emr data might make it easier for patients to switch health providers thus imposing such barriers to exit is a convenient way to retain patient base which in turn restricts the possibilities for analytics as a wide scale implementation advanced analytics the ibm watson ai debacle with inaccurate cancer predictions has raised a very important question on whether machines can be trusted with complex decisions in a business where the cost of failure is a life the value of which cannot be monetized a lot is at stake analytical models need to be trained to be able to make predictions with higher recall and this is possible only when the training data is quality data that accurately defined the past and as is situation data is ever changing and variables like regulatory changes environmental factors etc can change the analytical model in many ways and hence keeping up with such data is a big challenge deep learning models for prediction act as a black box with no clear understanding of how the predicted outcome is impacted by the input features the program named deep patient was trained using a large training dataset of over individuals without any expert intervention it discovered patterns in the data that predicted when people were on the way to a wide range of ailments especially mental illnesses and cancer which was a breakthrough however the only problem is that researchers are not yet sure how it was able to arrive at the results as the complete model is a blackbox this might increase the risk of the wrong diagnosis as there is no certainty of under which scenario the model might fail the only way to overcome these challenges is to layout stronger data governance laws ensure government regulations that do not allow providers to create barriers to exit for the patients and incentivize healthcare providers to adopt digital transformation strategies the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa is a step in the right direction to protect patient health information phi and mandates providers to set up a compliant infrastructure for threats against security however we still have a long way to go before the fears of both the health care providers and patients with electronic modes of capturing data are assuaged and we have better capabilities for capturing relevant data giving the much needed impetus to analytics in healthcare blackcoffer insights akshata nayak s p jain institute of management research spjimr,60,“sometimes illness sits body waiting time bloom ” remarked bob

are fostered by data these new services are the key differentiators of the most innovative companies service design is the best approach to innovate and create new data monetization applications a framework for data monetization today mega companies such as facebook and google derive a large portion of their revenue from the effective utilization of data they have mastered the art of data monetization — turning data assets into cold hard cash these companies offer a free public service that allows them to harvest massive amounts of data about their users they then provide this data — for a fee — to advertisers that want to create a personalized marketing experience here are several potential opportunities for data monetization identifying new revenue opportunities products markets or customer segments improving marketing impact through personalization identifying and proactively responding to customer satisfaction levels minimizing customer churn and extending customer retention optimizing the supply chain through data sharing with partners diagnosing revenue leaks and instituting corrective measures detecting and preventing fraud and piracy start to monetize your data today but to really know if you are ready to monetize you need to access what you have before you attempt to earn revenue from your information make sure that it is dependable relevant segment secure and anonymized developing capability for data monetization business models are already changing through the exploitation of information to be successful in this age of data monetization you must think creatively about how you hire talent and develop leaders the c suite executives who will help your business succeed today and certainly tomorrow will be different from the people who led blue chip firms or even years ago the route you take to data monetization will have an impact on the resources and capabilities your organization needs to steal a march on its rivals you — and your people — must adapt to this second wave of big data exploitation where insight shapes the new product and service development if the way to make dollars is through data then your organization and its people must make that shift get your capability ready now business model spectrum external data monetization models vary by level of value impact to customers analytics sophistication and revenue potential data as a service also known as data syndication this is the simplest of the three business models anonymized and aggregated data are sold either to intermediate companies or end customers who mine the data for insights insight as a service companies also can combine internal and external data sources applying advanced analytics to provide actionable insights akzonobel has created a

performance prediction of coating technologies this approach empowers vessel operators by allowing financial and performance benefit analysis of coating choices thus optimizing important investment decisions analytics enabled platform as a service this is the most complex of the three business models and it offers the greatest value to customers companies use sophisticated and proprietary algorithms to generate enriched highly transformed customized real time data delivered to customers via cloud based self service platforms setting up a data factory to maximize the potential for internal and external monetization companies should set up a “data factory” that automates the process of collecting enriching transforming and deriving insights from data it is a complex undertaking requiring a set of design principles that touch on design thinking lean start up and agile methodologies for success create a data platform the architecture and technology stack that supports a data monetization business model typically involves a robust enterprise data strategy and a “data platform” with an intuitive interface to allow analysis synthesis modeling and interaction with the data at a higher more visual level turning data into a strategic asset all companies are data companies and most have a substantial amount of untapped underutilized data which could unlock tremendous financial value there are three key components to complementing and even transforming a business model with a data factory identify potential internal and external monetization opportunities appraise your data identify any hidden opportunities to enrich it and increase insight value develop a strong monetization strategy and assess business opportunities dependencies and capability gaps key areas

the capital expenditure associated with these core activities is high and will only increase with the launch of g smart operators are looking at their huge data assets and creating new routes to market mobility companies that have hooked into the connected automobile ecosystem are already creating valuable products and services insurance firms for example are using telematics to monitor driver performance and charge premiums based on behavior payments payments data comes in multiple forms enterprise level information includes customer preferences line of business data and needs assessment supplemental data includes raw data from external sources such as social media and weather channels the merchant ecosystem meanwhile provides another conduit of information logistics logistics is the world's biggest integrated system every movement requires a huge amount of information about flow and smart businesses are tapping into this insight to see when the cost of movement is likely to be lowest ups for example is using telematics and advanced algorithms to create optimal routes for delivery drivers health care new entrants recognize the potential financial gains from data monetization in health care experts suggest that alphabet has at least nine life and science companies while amazon is looking at opportunities to use big data to transform health care conclusion very few organizations have established methods for data asset management it is not easy to implement if the business is not built on data from the beginning but it is not enough for data to be used only for the purposes of monitoring and maintaining physical assets that data needs to be monetized this in part is a process of generating new revenues from data that currently serves another purpose the business of data monetization is likely to evolve quickly payments providers would be well advised to begin planning their strategy without delay first mover advantage may determine future success a “start small scale fast” approach allows for flexibility learning and course correction as the business develops partnerships with complementary players in payments and in the digital and start up ecosystem could be a winning factor how much value could be created is difficult to estimate at this early stage but experience in some use cases and markets suggests it could amount to between and

134,the democratization of data access and usage in the enterprise is underway establishing data governance and organization wide information management becomes a must metadata management allows the end to end traceability from data sourcing to data consumption this traceability is required for personal data by regulations such as gdpr traceability traceability means transparency of flows of goods and data – a basic requirement for a modern supply chain consumers authorities and various quality assurance and product standards demand transparent information on raw materials and primary packaging brand owners need to be able to fully answer questions quickly at the batch level on the source of raw materials production methods and staging points with a good traceability information system a brand owner can guarantee protection for consumers and itself it can quickly contain any problems and provide adequate information which builds confidence among consumers and the authorities solution we choose muml as the underlying software design method due to its existing support for real time and due to our preliminary work on the approach cf sect furthermore we rely on consensus for the specification of requirements due to its tight integration with muml more precisely we provide the following partial solutions to the traceability problem for information flow requirements specification of illegitimate information flow at the level of consensus system models to address challenge c we provide systems engineers with a specification technique for information flow requirements allowing them to mark a flow between elements of a system or its environment as illegitimate the specification needs to take place in a form that enables a later comparison against the actual information flow detected through verification thus by distinguishing illegitimate from legitimate flow it is possible to judge whether the information flow requirements are violated deriving verifiable information flow properties from the specified requirements in an automatic fashion as a contribution to challenge c the derived properties relate the initial requirements to a muml software design model and allow to verify the model's compliance in order to produce meaningful verification results the derived properties need to preserve the semantics of the initial requirements and therefore the derivation needs to interrelate the consensus system model and the muml software design model it is beneficial to infer the relation between these models automatically from the traces of a model transformation real time verification of non interference properties on the basis of software design models in order to overcome challenge i e to decide whether a given muml model fulfills the derived information flow properties rigorous verification of the non interference needs to be carried out to this end we enrich the theoretical basis of real time non interference by a ready to use verification technique to cope with the infinite real valued state space we explicitly consider the applicability of existing verification techniques from the area of real time model checking reinterpretation of the verification results to trace them back to the initial requirements as a further contribution to challenge c depending on the complexity of the interrelations between muml software design and conses system model the verification results obtained so far are of little significance as they do not allow the engineers to draw immediate conclusions about the initial information flow requirements therefore in order to give significance to the results we automatically relate them back to the requirements specified initially every specified requirement needs to be marked as met if the non occurrence of information flow has been proved by the verification or as a violation if the verification detected the occurrence of an illegitimate flow previous studies have shown that software traceability the ability to link together related artifacts from different sources within a project e g source code use cases documentation etc improves project outcomes by assisting developers and other stakeholders with common tasks such as impact analysis concept location etc establishing traceability links in a software system is an important and costly task but only half the struggle as the project undergoes maintenance and evolution new artifacts are added and existing ones are changed resulting in outdated traceability information therefore specific steps need to be taken to make sure that traceability links are maintained in tandem with the rest of the project in this article we address this problem and propose a novel approach called trail for maintaining traceability information in a system advantages and benefits of full traceability traceability in an open supply chain which help company in achieving increase customer satisfaction and safety in the event a recall does take place manufacturers are able to minimize the impact by only recalling those items with the specific serial numbers that were built with the faulty component material or process – thus significantly reducing expenses and customer impact meet government and compliance mandates ease the burden and lessen the chances for fines and penalties associated with noncompliance improve data accuracy reduce human error save millions in lost revenue recall costs damage control campaigns litigation and fines mobile track and trace solutions can prevent quality issues before they occur or in the event of a product recall allow manufacturers to act swiftly as well as narrow the scope of the recall to reduce exposure to negative brand impressions and damage to revenues reduce warranty claim costs traceability enables manufacturers to accurately analyze the root cause of a product or part failure to recover warranty costs from liable suppliers with automation and traceability solutions for discrete manufacturers you can track warranty and part information to up sell and cross sell complementary products and services in addition labor hours can be reallocated to focus on revenue generating activities versus the double reporting that occurs when data is collected manually and then later transferred into a computer system for that purpose a traceability system identifies objects by using a representation format such as serial numbers or lot numbers as well as the transfer medium such as labels and rf tags when all people related to the supply chain including consumers can recognize the status of the product and objects and information has been linked tracing forward back can be done easily this ensures the quality and safety of the product we currently work towards reducing the verification problem to a refinement check for real time systems after preparing the verification backend we plan to address the requirements specification at the level of model based systems engineering and the derivation of verifiable properties within the next year finally we intend to carry out the final integration of systems engineering and software design in order to establish the desired traceability solution our evaluation strategy enables us to carry out a stepwise incremental validation of our contributions,55,democratization data access

135,current scenario in the past years indian banks have seen rapid growth in stressed assets with npas climbing from to of the total assets in the gnpa ratio rose to from last year the primary culprits of this have been public sector banks who have given and renewed loans to unworthy corporates like nirav modi kingfisher airlines another big blow to the banking sector came in september in the form of il fs crisis infrastructure leasing and financial services a publicly owned nbfc defaulted on loans worth rs crore which led to a liquidity crisis across indian nbfcs which had an impact on indian banks as well due to these developments the trust on indian financial sector seems to be lost and the rbi is taking a set of measures to revive the financial sector strategies to control npas preventive management preventive management is to save the asset from becoming npa this involves maintaining due diligence and doing proper credit assessment before granting loans curative management the curative measures are designed to speed up recoveries so that money which is locked up in npas is released quickly curative strategy to control the situation india had to definitely go for the curative strategy first insolvency and bankruptcy code ibc was passed in it has proved to be a major shot in the arm for the banks to fight npas since then it also has been amended several times to give it more strength the rbi also dissolved the existing corporate debt restructuring cdr for more comprehensive frameworks like sdr strategic debt restructuring sa and the new measures facilitate the conversion of outstanding loans into a majority shareholding in the company also they allow that for even a single day of default the bank can send the case to ibc adhikari in march rbi implemented the ban on lenders on issuing locs and lous for issuing overseas loans challenges to banking reforms though such due diligence is good in preventing the npas they have had limited effect only transition to sdr though a good move has not seen much success and in only one case it has shown some results the case of gammon india ibc has met some success but there are many challenges like lack of infrastructure so far only nclt benches have been set up across india upadhyay the move to ban buyer's credit has had an impact on trade financing in india importers used this instrument to avail of cheaper credit to pay suppliers post this ban they will have to rely upon bank guarantees which comes with its own limits also the ban on lcs will mean that corporates who have taken lcs will have to pay back as there will be no rollover archana gopakumar preventive strategy after addressing these challenges to curative strategy it is important to implement a preventive strategy so that banks can prevent loan write offs in the future an important aspect related to this is the basel norms basel is a city in switzerland and it is the location of the headquarters of the bank of international settlements bis which is the international body that sets rules for banking currently the indian banks are transitioning to basel iii norms basel iii norms have been implemented on april and will be fully implemented as on march one of the key shortcomings of the earlier basel accords was that it approached solvency of each institution independently basel iii has set its objectives to improve the shock absorbing capacity of each and every individual bank as the first priority and in the worst case if one or banks fail it ensures that banking system as a whole does not crumble as a spill over effect key aspects of basel iii norms basel iii norms identified sifis systematic important financial institutions and set a higher requirement for absorbency ratio than other banks because of their greater risk to the financial system a tier i extra capital ranging from for these banks shakdwipee mehta the basel iii capital regulations continue to be based on three mutually reinforcing pillars viz minimum capital requirements supervisory review of capital adequacy and market discipline of the basel ii capital adequacy framework the overall capital adequacy ratio proposed by rbi is at as against at present moreover the additional leverage ratio has been introduced at rbi two minimum standards viz liquidity coverage ratio lcr and net stable funding ratio nsfr for funding liquidity were prescribed by the basel committee rbi these aspects are illustrated in the figure given below source shakdwipee mehta macroeconomic effect of basel iii norms the increase in capital requirements will increase the weighted cost of capital for banks which will increase the lending rates bringing the common equity capital ratio to a level that would meet the agreed common capital requirement and capital conservation buffer would bring down the gdp result of basel iii norms clearly the immediate effect has to be negative and it was visible in the year when psbs posted significant losses fitch ratings stated that the progressive increase in minimum capital requirements under basel iii is likely to put nearly half of indian banks in danger of breaching capital triggers fitch estimates that indian banks will require around usdbn in new capital by fye to meet basel iii standards with the state banks accounting for about of the total hindu business line due to this the government has to extend the deadline to implement basel iii norms for indian banks by a year hindu business line after studying all this one thing is clear that implementing basel iii norms even in next year will not be a cakewalk the banks need to overhaul their risk management practices in order to bring this regulatory change the expanding role of risk management basel iii while on one hand basel iii increases cost in the form of technological investment it also presents an opportunity it presents an opportunity for banks to assess their operations and look for opportunities to create efficiency in the long run it will influence banks to move to a culture of risk and evidence based decision making cognizant technology has to take a central role in risk management to bring operational efficiency the organization needs to break silos and work as a single unit to discover insights where it needs to improve some examples can be considering liquidity management as a key aspect in processes such as deciding the product portfolio will help banks enhance their offerings merging similar type risk management systems for example consolidating anti fraud and anti money laundering system banks will be able to apply advanced analytics which will help them increase operational efficiency integrating products data such as credit card and deposits banks can find new ways to market their products and new target customers the road ahead insights implementing basel iii is no cakewalk and each bank needs to take a deep analysis of its processes they should invest in prudent technological investments and bring operational efficiency in their processes use of fintech can be one option other than that bigger industry players can find ways to collaborate with third party experts like cloud service providers and provide small and emergent players consultancy on risk management banks may try to divest capital intensive businesses or try to merge them with

136,recent years have seen significant growth in personal financial wealth in alone there was more than percent growth in personal financial wealth opportunities posed by this growth are tremendous but the wealth managers are struggling to manage their profit margins or increase their profit margins this is due to a plethora of causes like stricter regulation by the institution increase in demanding customer and digital disruption still the top performers in the segment are enjoying more margin than others and this difference is continuously increasing revenue is more important than the cost reduction in driving profits top performers – those with higher pre tax profit margins – achieved a significant advantage over average performer by focusing on revenue growth and return on assets in past years along with significantly better price realization in every client segment – as cited by a researcher from bcg the top performer also enjoys a cost advantage but that is less pronounced than roa this suggested that the revenue is the main driver for profit margin the manager can achieve higher revenue by adjusting price levels removing unnecessary discounts and simplifying overall pricing structure pricing information is easily available combining with analytics and data tools they become truly powerful the manager should understand the present abnormalities and inconsistent for optimizing the pricing opportunities and driving the margins they can focus on two major areas firstly the realization of pricing offered to the client managers often give discounts to book business at the expense of revenue margin company's weak guidance for discounting the customer and infrequent review of the existing discounts exemplifies the issue furthermore often the manager fails to apply fees increase to the existing clients using the value based pricing – offering discounts based on requirement and timely removal of the discount – the system will help in capitalizing this revenue gap secondly designing the pricing system for the organization pricing should be based on the value generated and perceived by the customer most of the existing pricing is complex and opaque which makes it difficult for the customer even the manager to understand this creates an improper product bundle and misprices offering to the customer organization loosely defines the client segment which extends the pricing benefit beyond the intended client segment implementing smart pricing system can significantly drive the revenue a successful pricing transformation should consider various factors like adjustment to deal with pricing outliers stringent policies for tracking and reporting the realization of the price at client and manager level manager's training and coaching and incentives to the manager for implementing the smart pricing system some managers may have misperceived risk of client attrition in recent research it has been found that clients are not specially priced sensitive most of the clients have very low awareness about the fees that managers charges though they appreciate discount they are not aware of what exactly has been offered to them importantly most clients focus far more on the overall experience they receive by increasing the overall client experience and satisfaction the organization can reap remarkable benefits a content customer shows certain kinds of behavior – hard to quantify – leads to increased and stable revenue they tend to use more of institutional services and refers to their friends and relatives according to recent research the building block of selection and retention of content clients are trust reassurance personalized experience convenience and investment performance on par with other service providers moreover clients expectation and needs change with time the service provider must change to cater to those needs a service provider must be able to provide a personalized experience and meet the changing needs of the client personalize experience can be created by leveraging the full spectrum of existing data and using advanced analytics to make a personalized profile based on customer needs preferences context and experience sharp execution of customized experience from delivering the standard experience is challenging for accomplishing this enormous task firms need to develop a new cutting edge technology based advance analytics capacities using a new technology platform next generation technology and data architecture and improved access to the internal and external data some players are taking actions in smaller steps by developing a small and new analytics team and investing in a new platform customer experience can be further enhanced by generating curated communication and finding the optimal frequency and medium for communication using analytics such analytics can also flag ways to reduce unwanted communication and an ideal time for initiating cross selling and drive a customer toward research and investment ideas in specific sectors moreover it will also maximize the relationship manager rm efficiency by defining the adequate frequency of client communication especially for low frequency communication client rm could divide his crucial time propositional to the real value of the client to the firm refined procedure or sequence can be established for client communication in case of market abnormally for reassurance and retention this optimization will help rm to increase the portion of time toward client acquisition which will directly impact business expansion advanced analytics can also increase the top line growth in addition to the above mentioned points analytics can identify the early signs of potential client attrition by observing the trading pattern in a few recent cases the firm was able to identify the possible client attrition by observing the trading pattern and able to mitigate by successful communication in these cases earlier the identification easier for firms to retain clients few recent research has shown that the firm can decrease the client attrition by to using specific analytics technique furthermore sharpen the target price based on client specific price sensitivity individual scenario and long term perspective the dynamic pricing model can also be created the success of the advanced analytics will depend on having or developing a foundation of the key capabilities combining them effectively and managing the complexity will need tenacious leadership few of the key capabilities that the firm should look for are cutting edge technology architecture sharp data capture and governance innovative analytics capabilities and change management with cutting edge technology there is no single solution for all players it varies from players and market and the firm must be ready to iterate for the ideal technology but the technology should provide a single outcome to the result and able to find relevant data from the large pool of structured and unstructured data major challenges lie in capturing and structuring already existing data the specific history of the client or winning strategy for specific clients the firm can develop a model to capitalize and analyze the technique used by experience rm toward acquisition retaining and deriving customer satisfaction for specific clients this model will be difficult to build because most of the data variable will be difficult to quantify a firm must develop their innovative analytics capabilities for creating difficult models and improving the analysis of currently available data knowing how to apply the right analytics method to a business problem requires a different type of investment other than system and data taking the first step is the most difficult point for the firm the firm can take one of the two most common practice approaches firstly firms can create a detailed road map then invest in the required capabilities and makes necessary organizational changes accordingly secondly learning by doing rapidly creating and prioritizing a long list of use cases specific to the firm the second case has a higher chance of success for the firm blackcoffer insights obenesh hazra iim ranchi,73,recent years significant growth personal financial wealth percent

this data and provide a summary of what people like and do not like about a company or its products it helps the company make better decisions on their products through analytics the customer segmentation and profiling on the basis of customer spending patterns for instance a person who is a heavy loan payer may exhaust all his income at once can help the banks or financial institutions to plan the bottom line and maximize their income with the help of big data analytics banks can analyze the market trends and decide on lowering or increasing interest rates for different individuals across various regions policy formation and regulatory norms data analytics tools are used by the rbi to monitor inflation on a real time basis the financial system is now completely computerized as large volumes of data are generated on a daily basis a dynamic database of bank lending activity could help a regulator spot outlier activity that may lead to trouble later this assumes that data across the banking sector is aggregated trends in retail lending can also be spotted by plugging into the databases of consumer credit rating agencies big data analytics can help to analyze the ongoing activity in the financial system and mitigate the upcoming risk in spite of tightening regulations there are financial frauds in companies as mentioned previously the list of defaulters in the

terms the same saying goes for any financial institution bank operates in a dynamic business environment and faces multiple risks with risk comes the concept of risk management risk management refers to the identification and assessment of potential risk and the development and execution of plans to deal with such risks in the banking industry risk management focuses on managing the bank's exposure to losses or risk and to protect the value of its assets revenue operations business and reputation to understand the future of bank risk management let us quickly go through the major banking risk one by one – liquidity risk – risk when banks are not able to meet its short term financial obligations and day to day operational expense leading to cash crunch credit risk – risk of default of debt payment by the borrower attributes to credit risk one can relate the credit risk with the financial crises were credit fell and the borrower was unable to pay their debts which then turned into liquidity crises for the banks strategic risk – risk arising from the bank's long term strategy the bank needs to be agile to the needs of changing the business environment or else it can lose market share compliance risk – risk arising from failure to comply with enforced laws and regulations reserve bank of india fine on banks including icici for failing to comply with its guidelines

the largest diamond and jewelry businesses in the country making it the largest fraud to be detected operation risk – faulty internal process systems and human errors lead to operational risk now how the future of the bank risk management will look like – process automation – in the coming decade most of the routine operational business process in risk dealing with customers will be automated ai algorithms machine learning will lead to increase in productivity and will help banks to reduce operational cost and chances of human error thereby managing operational risk compliance risk and credit rate some banks had already started investing in process automation bny mellon's an american banking company efforts to transition staff members to robotics and automation have resulted in huge sustained cost savings and increased productivity as a result there was better accuracy and faster processing reducing transaction time and eliminating manual steps thus resources redeployment created greater value for its clients robust data infrastructure –there will be a need for reliable data pool at the back end and flexible infrastructure at the front end this will make the customer more engaged with the bank through real time data processing like loan approval there will be huge investments in it infrastructure data centers and software a robust data infrastructure will be key to banking operation efficiency and risk minimization in the future td bank a us national bank has embarked on an effort to transform traditional banking data infrastructure into a more modern system built on a new application framework and apis collaborations – to meet the competition many banks might collaborate with peer banks or fintech startups to retain and gain a customer base and to manage third party risk fintech startups are the new buzz of the market which provides highly competitive and seamless zero documentation services to customers focusing on niche areas of the supply chain – origination sales and distribution bank can collaborate with these fin tech companies or peer banks in effectively managing third party risk banks like citizens bank ally bank have joined together as investors and members in kyp a company dedicated to working with the financial industry to standardize best practices for managing third party risk and optimizing the processes by which financial institutions assess and monitor inherent risk in engaging suppliers and entering into third party relationships analytics and machine learning – it is a tool which will be widely used by the financial institutions especially where data needs to be interpreted and acted upon it will help banks to manage risk appetite by providing meaningful data patterns and trends which will form the base for decision making like improvement in the identification of risky customers considering default risk from top to bottom machine learning will be integrated into the process and will become an integral part of the overall process paypal is one of the best examples – the company which supports billion payment transactions annually in more than countries around the world is deploying technology thereby enabling the usage of data driven intelligence across the entire value chain manpower talent pool – in the coming future there will be a shift of resources allocation from processes to data analytics at present almost of staff is handling operational process which will be bought down to and analytics will employ of manpower which is at present bank will hire a lot of different talent pool who understand application of data analytics and statistics in decision making banks will partner with top universities and institutes featuring training in data analytics as a part of risk management apart from hiring retaining talent and continuous knowledge upgrade will also become a focus area for banks system audits – since many operations will be automated system audits will play a very crucial role to ensure reliability and efficiency of data systems system audit will play a crucial role in identifying loopholes in the systems and thus bringing out areas of the potential risk so that timely corrective action plans can be put in place to mitigate risk auditing in the future will focus on creating risk based audit plans and testing the frameworks rather than just controls cyber security – mobile and internet penetration has rocketed the use of internet banking increasing the risk of leakage of confidential information can put operations of the bank to halt the average cost of cybercrime for financial services has increased from million usd per firm in to million usd in which is almost percent over the past three years to minimize cyber risk the bank will make major investments in cybersecurity minimize cybersecurity threat in the future will be one of the most challenging tasks in the future considering its nature and huge risk potential attached to it banking risk management will undergo a major change from what it looks now as there will be new challenges for the business customers want real time service and update which will require huge investments in technology and artificial intelligence there would be pressure on banks to provide real time services with a reduced cost affecting bank margins with the financial crises day on day new regulatory

139,in the past decade there has been a fundamental change in the daily operations of the bank with completely aiming to transform the operations digitally the banks especially the private banks have invested a lot in technology to reduce manual labor and to create a more streamlined process however this has exposed the banks to unwanted new risks while banks take a strategic risk aversion strategy to minimize risk the phases they have been through are restored rationalize reinvent they have clearly marked only the first phase of restore through strict regulations and compliances from the regulating bodies both in india and internationally making it clear that we are far away from seeing the risk free banking utopia risk management is not the same as risk avoidance it is about making risk informed decision to diminish the probability of it affecting the bank in the long term it talks about sustained growth and while processing these risks they must make sure that no new risk is created history has always been a keen teacher in reflecting our faults the financial crisis has been one of the biggest eye openers for banks through its inception even the bassel norms in underwent a huge change pertaining to different banking risks such as the supervision risk operational risk and liquidation risk in the present when we are opening banking to a more digital platform it is more vulnerable to risks both old and new risks some of the contemporary risks would include cybersecurity risk and privacy risk with the digital transformation setting it is imperative that different banks would undergo disruption to create a unique model or an example to follow by being the first to adopt the new technologies makes them the first to be exposed to vulnerability to gain more attraction for customers banks are trying to highlight their easy to use services accessible from home when it comes to banks the future is a double edged sword after all the banks are involved in the nitty gritty and the economy of the system failure of which can reduce the nation into rubbles for banks this means a certain level of changes needs to be made into the system such as tightening regulations on both the banking system and its employees aligning customer expectations and risk aversion to changing technology removing biases arising from human intervention in risk management by introducing digital networks banks have only just started to realize the problems arising from these new risks while they are trying to minimize problems pertaining to a cyber security risk credit risk and operations risk they have yet to realize other kinds of risks that are influenced by external factors and directly or indirectly harm the bank management system prominent amongst these are the geopolitical and socio political risk that arises due to the global penetration of banks in different cultures and countries without trying to adapt to the local situations they might seem trivial but the macroeconomic conditions guided by politics and regulations in a new emerging market can make or break the bank the near future seems direr with any bank coming with the prospectus of being in the game for indefinite years they are more at risk with a potentially long term effect on customer acquisition and customer service two vital features in today's banking prerogative for tomorrow's banking with upcoming technologies like the internet of things and artificial intelligence or human factors like population growth and mass migration the long term risk will be huge enough to outweigh the short gains got from managing short term risks these may be caused due to reputational risk or conduct risk which as a non metric risk is not quantifiable but are totally dependent on how banks portray themselves over the years banks have been provided with several regulations to create failsafe measures to avoid these risks however as banks advance and are trying to get more competitive it has become imperative that the risks also differs banks must become more cautious and adopt new practical methods different from their rudimentary ways to counter them a good risk management system is one that can support the bank's abilities to react to short term risk all the while circumventing itself from long term risk that may occur sooner or later such efficiency is important because it can devise new operations and talent models to better cover risk without doing irredeemable damage but it is not just the system that needs to be efficient but the role professional plays is equally important there is a need to have better decision making capabilities that balance the gains with the losses incurred all in all a good risk management technique is one that can sense the disruption in technology and can adapt itself in a reliable system to minimize damage both in the short term and in the long term blackcoffer insights harsh pipada vaibhav omer

140,the banking industry is going through a transformational journey with the comprehensive usage of advanced analytics algorithms in day to day business of core banking customer acquisition through various channels existing customer engagement predicting defaulters on credit card or loan applications etc are few of the areas where analytics is doing a tremendous job i will explain some scenarios from my past experience of working in the advanced analytics team of a leading multinational bank where we had used some interesting concepts from analytics and machine learning to solve complex business problems customer is god or is it so it is impossible to track god but you can track your potential customers with the help of advanced analytics algorithms a lot of information about their buying patterns demographics transactions service requests etc are available with banks this is being used efficiently to predict the propensity of a customer buying a specific product while working in the analytics department i collaborated with many sales teams which needed a rank ordered list of potential future customers for direct mailer cold calling campaigns the campaigns usually contain an attractive offer specific to the product like lower interest rate for a credit card higher interest on savings account etc which are hedged by confidence that the significant number of customers from the ranked list would be up for buying the product as opposed to the ones being contacted randomly not only potential customers for a product but also which customers are having the mindset to close their account customer attrition is being predicted data science algorithms such as logistic regression work well in predicting the probability of customer propensity to buy or customer attrition probability for example consider the below real life business problem a leading mnc bank wants to formulate a strategy to curb the customer attrition which is constantly on the rise for their savings account product they reach out to the advanced analytics department to help them in retaining their best customers by predicting which one of them is having a propensity towards closing their account so that they can connect with them and offer attractive offers to continue their invaluable relationship the advanced analytics team starts with first narrowing down the problem and defining attrition for eg customers taking out their parked money closing their savings account and not reinvesting their money with another product offered by the same bank the business wants to predict attrition months in advance to get sufficient time to design a retention strategy the team then moves on to collect the required data which usually takes up most of the time in the project as questions like which data to collect for how much time period what additional data is needed etc are very critical requirements once the stage is set the data scientists perform their final act – machine learning the algorithms will read the data and find out patterns leading to attrition behavior based on previous account closures it will then leverage this learning on newly available customer information in the current scenario and predicts the probability of attrition i came across an astounding project predicting customer propensity to buy retail banking products years from today guess what was the driving feature in these algorithms that is right current educational background and achievements tracked on business social media websites lead to understanding where the person would want to park their money in the future one very interesting use of natural language processing algorithms like naïve bayes classifier in retail banking is into analyzing transactions each transaction is associated with a code and a short description data scientists use language parsing to extract keywords or tokens from the humongous text generated to read through the description and discover more about the transaction it can be identified whether you have paid for a product at a retail store transferred money to another bank account that you hold or paid the bill of a credit card from another bank the transactions can be then linked to how you value your current relationship with the bank and the business can decide upon various customer outreach strategies based on this critical information they buy what they see according to the laws of economics choices spoil us the more the options in front of customers the more confused they become and the more chances of not buying the product a very niche field that makes use of hardcore machine learning algorithms is targeted digital marketing and retail banking is constantly using this to identify and catch potential customers visiting the website by displaying customized web content which caters to the needs of visitors and offer products they are looking for how does the business know what the customer wants digital footprints millions of website visitors generate thousands of gbs of data that contain information such as what channel they come from which is the most frequent landing page on the bank's website which pages they scan through how much time they spend reading the content how many unique visits they make per day or week etc this data is called the digital footprint of a website visitor also called clickstream data banking and financial institutions have been churning this data to generate accurate information about what exactly the visitor is looking for and they efficiently display customized content to the visitors with products that they would be interested in displayed on the home page this prompts the visitor to click on the display link and understand more about the product as the saying goes they buy what they see you should not display too much content altogether as it will confuse the visitor and they might log off without making any deal or without leaving their information to be contacted later the information from digital footprints can be customized to the extent of what rate the visitor would convert on customized content is displayed based on which current visitors show characteristics of other visitors in the past who got converted since the conversion rate is minimal as only a few out of millions of visitors on the bank's website actually buy a product or service online we need to use some very powerful machine learning algorithms that can catch the pattern with the limited amount of data to learn on also there is a huge amount of data that needs to be read through by the algorithm as digital footprints get generated with each second machine learning algorithms such as random forest which use bagging methodology or gradient boosting which use boosting methodology come to the rescue these algorithms are efficient in handling huge amount of data and can identify patterns with good accuracy data scientists also use a technique called stacking where outputs of different algorithms are combined and fed into another model to calculate probability as a combination of various machine learning algorithms so the next time you visit a bank's website and pop up displays offering an attractive interest rate on the home loan be assured that a heavily loaded machine learning algorithm running in the background has monitored your activity on the website and knows what you are looking for clustering – the one stop shop for analytics solutions majority of decision making in banks and financial institutions is done by dividing things into groups that have similar characteristics and behave in a particular way so that decisions may be applied in batches which saves time energy and of course money clustering algorithms to the rescue i cannot count the number of times we proposed clusters as a solution to a business problem but would share two instances i distinctly remember where we did so the first one was for a bank which wanted to identify its most loyal customers from well not so loyal our approach was to define loyalty based on three metrics recency of transactions frequency of transactions and the monetary value of transactions better known as rfm model in analytics world these three metrics combined with a certain weight assigned to each one based on what is more important to the business enable us to rank which customers are interacting more as compared to others who eventually are dormant and fall in not so loyal category an important consideration is to study the transactions in depth otherwise errors might creep in for instance and this is very interesting when we developed the categories based on rfm score we saw every single savings account holder scored very high on recency value this was very intriguing for us and we spent days in identifying what was happening only to later realize that every savings account has an interest receivable by the account holder and it credits to the account at the end of each month the trade offs of being too technical i suppose the second instance was when the business wanted to identify bank branches that have lower than average performance on metrics like new customers acquired average balances maintained in accounts quality of home loan applications sent to head branch for approval promoter score of customers employee attrition etc using k means clustering we identified and differentiated all the high performing branches on these metrics from the lower ones this helped the bank in taking decisions like reviewing the financial targets for lower performing branches or provide focus on employee training and also incentivize the high performing branches to inspire others the core idea behind all advanced analytics and data science algorithms is to help the business make better decisions faster they say data is the new oil and analytics is the process of converting oil to fuel blackcoffer

141,to completely understand about marketing analytics and why do we care about it we must first clear our basics like what is marketing analytics marketing analytics is a study of process and technology that enable marketers to analyze data and metrics to determine the dynamics of a special market within a special industry and also help in understanding the impact and measure performance based on marketing activities it uses the important measure to maximize roi and identify the areas of improvement overall marketing effectiveness source why marketing analytics as businesses expand into a new market new technologies were adopted to support them diverse technologies were implemented across several platforms in order for companies to advertise market and clear brand awareness as a marketer along with your long task list you need to be conversant with every new marketing medium that is introduced but how do you know which of your efforts are making a difference is the new platform or new technology that you just signed up for even bringing in any results companies need to analyze data from a combination of channels where marketing activity was carried out this permits them to be sure about campaign performance but initially marketers were only checking for data and deciding about campaign success you cannot rely on guesswork or gut feeling to be successful in this era of marketing you need to back up the feasibility of every activity with facts and figures it helps you understand which marketing activities are bringing in revenue marketing analytics eliminated this roadblock by facilitating data scrutiny across all channels stakeholders now had enhanced clarity about product performance marketing analytics was revolutionary in changing the marketing dynamic steps of marketing analytics success find your objective and create strategy before the marketing analytics the company should design a bright strategy based on the company objectives several tools are available in the digital marketplace that allows companies to construct tailor made campaigns which revolve around their product and help them find their company objectives in the market these tools center around search engine audience sentiment about popular keywords trends popular hashtags among many others by building a campaign that includes these words marketers can place their bets for a campaign victory the strategy is the key and depending on brand perception platforms that resonate the product should be engaged in the campaign once the campaign is launched back end analytic tools come into the picture these tools will allow marketers to check for various aspects that encapsulate the digital marketing spectrum like conversions incoming leads website traffic etc determine a data model vast amounts of data get generated during the campaigning process which can be converted into meaningful insights marketers need to ensure that they have covered and collated data elements getting generated from all the sources which were involved in a marketing campaign the data generated would be unstructured a model consists of columns in a spreadsheet and calculation used to give you results or metrics this is the perfect time to understand what data you have to work with and to possibly bring in an experienced analyst to assist with questions you may have more to work with than you initially thought so it is best to lay it all out this data can later be structured by the use of several tools to get transparency about how customers are shopping today with an increasing number of people buying products on their mobile phones entrepreneurs are trying to make shopping as rapid as possible for this group of buyers omnichannel e commerce platforms are also the rage the scope of marketing analytics just like data analysis can give specific insights the overall scope of marketing analytics can be put in a nutshell by these functions assessing marketing campaigns marketing analytics tools provide precise information about campaign performance along with determining areas of improvement if any and predicting how they would perform in the future competitor assessment tools help to understand if the competitor campaign is doing better and why it is doing better it helps to understand what competitors are doing right and if they are using certain channels that might garner more campaign success assessing the company that has initiated the marketing campaign finally it allows you the campaign originator to reflect as an organization if the marketing resource allocation is appropriate or not it also helps in understanding the next steps that need to be taken allowing to reshuffle priorities lastly it helps to understand if money and time are being immersed in the right marketing mediums use a balanced assortment of analytics techniques to get the most benefit from marketing analytics you need an analytic assortment that is balanced – that is one that combines techniques for reporting on the past by using marketing analytics to report on the past you can answer such questions as which campaign elements generated the most revenue last quarter how did an email campaign a perform against direct mail campaign b how many leads did we generate from blog post c versus social media campaign d analyzing the present marketing analytics enables you to determine how your marketing initiatives are performing right now by answering questions like how are our customers engaging with us which channels do our most profitable customers prefer who is talking about our brand on social media sites and what are they saying predicting and or influencing the future marketing analytics can also deliver data driven predictions that you can use to influence the future by answering such questions as how can we turn short term wins into loyalty and ongoing engagement how will adding more sales people in under performing regions affect revenue which cities should we target next using our current portfolio create actionable reporting and fill in the gaps marketing organizations have access to a lot of different analytic capabilities in support of various marketing goals but if you are like most you probably do not have all your bases covered assessing your current analytic capabilities is a good next step after all it is important to know where you stand along the analytic spectrum so you can identify where the gaps are and start developing a strategy for filling them in for example a marketing organization may already be collecting data from online and pos transactions but what about all the unstructured information from social media sources or call center logs such sources are a gold mine of information and the technology for converting unstructured data into actual insights that marketers can use exists today as such a marketing organization may choose to plan and budget for adding analytic capabilities that can fill that particular gap of course if you are not quite sure where to start well that is easy start where your needs are greatest and fill in the gaps over time as new needs arise apply learning and validate there is absolutely no real value in all the information marketing analytics can give you – unless you act on it in a constant process of testing and learning marketing analytics enables you to improve your overall marketing program performance by for example identifying channel deficiencies adjusting strategies and tactics as needed optimizing processes gaining customer insight without the ability to test and evaluate the success of your marketing programs you would have no idea what was working and what was not when or if things needed to change or how by the same token if you use marketing analytics to evaluate success but you do nothing with that insight then what is the point applied holistically marketing analytics allows for better more successful marketing by enabling you to close the loop as it relates to your marketing efforts and investments for example marketing analytics can lead to better supply and demand planning price optimization as well as robust lead nurturing and management all of which leads to more revenue and greater profitability by more effectively managing leads and being able to tie those leads to sales – which is known as closed loop marketing analytics – you can see which specific marketing initiatives are contributing to your bottom line conclusion in the realm of marketing primary research has traditionally focused on quantitative or qualitative methodologies to provide customer insights with advances in technology especially data mining marketing analytics has become an invaluable tool and should be viewed as an equal component of the marketing research toolkit analytics requires marketers to use data to understand customers at every touch point throughout their lifecycle with the business to do this the analyst must mine analyze interpret and present the information so that it is converted into actionable intelligence in this process the customer's information dna is tracked segmented modeled and then acted upon as these concepts and tools become standard operating procedures marketing departments must internalize analytics into their overall curriculum in order to provide company with a compelling competitive advantage,71,completely understand marketing analytics care clear basics marketing analytics marketing analytics study process technology enable marketers

142,developing countries have created the biggest data repository in the world now faces the challenge of using the information for better governance as per the official report big data is defined by the variety volume speed and analytics involve in processing cost effectively to be able to draw conclusions for their useful application from transforming development initiatives to improving transparency big data analytics can have a major impact on the way governments work new opportunities and new risks big data and government agencies are teaming up to help agencies run more efficiently and better serve constituents at all levels due to recent technological advancements government agencies are now leveraging big data insights in a variety of innovative ways with increased requirements of data at the higher managerial level or declining budgets they are looking to do more with less— a path of digital transformation can help them get there at the same time government agencies are modernizing their data warehouses by using advanced technological tools optimizing their enterprise resource planning solutions and commoditizing their storage so as to reduce red tapism and enhance more transparency in the system big data brings new opportunities as well as new risks when it comes to integrity and confidentiality of data thus good data governance is pivotal for organizations in the big data world these days further companies have to adopt practical steps to manage them effectively huge data and associated analytics are advantageous in numerous areas such as efficient supply chain management targeting healthcare delivery providing personalized education for students preventive steps to protect the environment enabling security for people and society informed policy decision making resolving traffic problems in cities applications of big data the potential of big data can be easily used by government agencies by employing sufficient method through the collection transformation and processing of information getting from various sources big data provides a big opportunity for government agencies to process it accurately which helps to make a proper decision identifying corruption criminal and challenges and threats and making a future decision it is not only useful for public sector organizations like government actors cities and citizens but also health care and social media since the government has a major responsibility to generate and managing knowledge government is a center of both creating and managing knowledge so the government can manage it by analyzing big data through analysis critical aspects of big data one of the most critical aspects of data analytics is its effect on how decisions are made and who makes such crucial decisions when data is costly to obtain scarce or unavailable in digital form it makes sense to allow people with experience to make decisions based on relationships and patterns they have observed from data leaders state their opinions on what the future brings what will happen how well something would work and so on as per their intuition and plans accordingly in the era of growing usages of big data managers and leaders in private companies and the government should be data driven they must avoid using hit and trial basis of work and rather do what the data states this needs a change in mindset from using the traditional way of doing the work manually and effective training is needed to make decisions based on data driven though businesses have tried hard to adopt data and analytics in different forms efficiently to boost business efficiency and personalize offerings governments have been laggards the possible benefits that data analytics could bring to the government could vary from transforming the programs of the government like using big data and analytics where data is more complex for human interface to interpret and empowering citizens thereby to boost transparency and to enable participation of all stakeholders the government in a big data world governments differ from businesses when it comes to goals mission and decision making though decision makers in businesses are limited there is a diverse set in government the government has tremendous data in legacy databases collected from various sources and forms that must be curated and migrated for new age analytic tools further data collection is a paramount task for the government since data is received from numerous online and offline channels data sharing and retaining it between departments and across ministries is a challenge provided the existing jurisdictional boundaries data analytics when properly managed could be a blessing for the government struggling to gain bigger insights about any particular projects or for the future course of action for an economy as a whole however it could also be a curse to the organizations and governments that are not prepared to handle the untold x bytes of unstructured data pouring unceasingly into their coffers this is the dilemma most companies wake up to every day and thus they capture only a fraction of the value that data analytics brings realizing the essence of digital advancement big data could have a huge impact only when used on a massive scale with safeguards by the government for the delivery of public services and goods every government agency should adopt big data technology for reducing corruption threat and challenges and increasing efficiency accountability and transparency which will help to

143,good governance is key to the growth and progress of any country and this cannot just be achieved through better policymaking but also through its implementation at the ground level in real time which leads to the overall development of any economy as well as its society now the policies are made to benefit society as a whole and our policymakers have the responsibility to implement these decisions for the betterment of people due to the emergence of the latest technologies like big data the effectiveness of these policies can be tracked easily through a real time collection of data and applying data analytics to measure the effect being achieved or not for example through the advent of government initiatives like digital india an infrastructure has been set up so that all the government's services are made available to deliver services online by leveraging the internet and information technology political leaders in several states of india have started adopting these technologies for real time governance across the state to help better address analytical requirements that facilitate state level decision making for example the andhra pradesh government has used digital technology in every department and has launched real time monitoring where the chief minister monitors the performance of each department through cm office real time executive core dashboard as the data is updated automatically another such example is in the state of odisha where lpg distribution center was opened in areas which needed them the most and not where lpg companies see the most demand that was done using geospatial analytics also many not for profit development organizations like swaniti initiative is working on innovative projects on analyzing data for the indian government they collect analyze and visualize data which is used to design the development programs they partnered with the andhra pradesh cm's office to provide the data insights on agriculture that helped design a seed dissemination program so our political leaders can play an important role in providing effective governance if they leverage these new technologies adoption of these big data and analytics can play a major role in the overall development of society these political leaders can take advantage of the power of it infrastructure in their respective areas and can use the technology of big data to bring in transparency and accountability in governance there are many other government institutions and departments like the income tax department that can use data analytics to scan through income and expenditure patterns of tax return filers and use it to detect black money generation similarly such tools can also be used to detect terror and crime financing by analyzing the pattern of transactions being done through respective accounts as tax collection is the major source of income for the government they can strengthen the it department with these technologies to counter the tax evasion problems faced by the government and trace the loopholes in the system also they can create a team of data scientists for several departments of government to keep track of functions and administrations so that everyone can come under the lens of performance check with data based results artificial intelligence based systems can be used for fraud detection in several government institutions and hence can act upon that also within time to avoid further setbacks another example where these systems can be used extensively are in the areas of land and property holding records to detect fraud and forging of documents as most of the documents related to properties are still paper based hence it needs to be strengthened through advanced big data and analytics systems to keep a proper track record also it can be used in our judicial system to track the number of pending cases as well as important cases that have been pending for a long time and yet not resolved further it can be used for tracking the healthcare facilities and monitoring their performance through artificial intelligence and data analytics like what is the quality of treatment and facilities being offered to the people in these state run hospitals and whether the government spending on healthcare is actually utilized or not effectively now these things can be achieved if these political leaders try to inculcate the data driven decision making practices in their processes for this first they need to invest more in setting up more data warehouses so that data can be collected and stored as well as bring more data scientists to work on these areas so that administration can be monitored in real time and government can function on data based results as the government spends lots of money on several schemes for public welfare the effectiveness of these schemes plays a major role in helping society also also the government can partner with several institutions as well as companies working in these fields to provide solutions as well as collaborative research can be done to find the solutions for these real world problems many political parties had already used data analytics in their electoral campaign program to understand the voter stance of a particular demographic and have campaigned accordingly which has resulted in a better outcome for the electoral results for example the lok sabha elections was a prime example of using data driven techniques for electoral campaigning so the political leaders also now understand the benefits of using these technologies in decision making and hence if they create an infrastructure to use it on a larger scale in day to day governance a lot of work can be fast tracked and hence ease them in administration also today perhaps india owns the largest data repository in the world gathered via digitalization of records for purposes like aadhaar card passports pan card kisan credit card etc there is a massive amount of data that government has and if they use it positively then there is a lot of opportunities to apply this data to improve the citizens' service experience and government efficiency especially in the delivery of services to the common people this can also be applied to the farming sector whereby water demand can be predicted in needy areas having a higher reliance on agriculture and producing in large amounts water supply problems soon can also be predicted data analytics can be used to get farmers a better price for their agricultural produce by producing crops having higher expected demand or avoiding crops which will have higher failure probability in the education sector it can be used to predict the demand for the number of schools teachers reading materials etc in areas where these facilities are not in reach and their performance can also be monitored by the respective district departments so basically these technologies have a wide application in major areas like healthcare education transportation agriculture etc and if implemented can lead to positive results in the near future in terms of better governance but this needs to be done with proper planning and proper channels as data security is also a big concern and a data warehouse has the huge challenge of cybersecurity issues because in case of the data breach all the data could be affected and might lead to misuse of the data so if our political parties could leverage these technologies in their respective areas the benefit is huge and can help them in achieving better governance as well as greater accountability to the people blackcoffer insights abhishek kumar joydeep datta iim visakhapatnam,40,good governance key growth progress country achieved policymaking implementation ground

144,“politics is not a game it is an earnest business” the above quote by winston churchill highlights the fact that politics is not made for the light hearted or those who are in it for fun it is not a dreamers' palace but a pit where rivals fight it out to succeed in recent times technology has completely changed how political leaders compete the presence of multiple platforms microbloggers and hundreds of social media websites has changed the dynamics of the pit completely data analytics was a buzzword during barack obama's election campaigns in and it is also believed that predictive models and extensive analysis of the data of us citizens helped him turn the tides in his favor in us elections post saw a decrease in traditional advertising expenditure from to less than these elections also saw a man with no political experience take the reins of the most powerful country in the world cambridge analytica infamously known for harvesting data from facebook was awarded the research focused arf ogilvy awards in the following year and the dependence of the world on data analytics was reiterated elections are not just campaigns based on sentiments hunches and popular opinions instead influencers and digital trends lead the way in swaying masses to favor an electoral candidate big data is considered to be empowering for political leaders when a political leader decides to contest an election he has terabytes of data on what opinion people have of him what is expected of the next leader how many people might vote for him and most importantly what are the most pressing concerns in the society extensive data mining and collecting data after every event has given political leaders an opportunity to adopt a modular approach and voice a different concern to different people this has reduced the number of misfires significantly through analytics political leaders and their research teams have been able to categorize the entire population on the basis of psychographic segmentation these segmentations have enabled political leaders to include personalized and tailor made strategies to be more closely affiliated with people every word that a political leader says is backed by algorithms which makes the delivery impeccable this unparalleled precision is what draws political leaders to adopt data based campaigns social media content is now being altered accordingly as well people with similar political interests would find similar content on social media this content would be coherent to their interests which ensures that the user is bound to read it when a common man is checking his notifications for early morning updates he is being targeted by the research team of a political campaign without him realizing it campaigns have limited financial resources when the resources are limited information such as the amount of contact required for a particular constituency and which population to target can help in the effective utilization of resources a political leader can recognize constituencies that could swing either way or the ones which are a lost cause and effectively manage resources to produce favorable results analytics firms collect huge amounts of data algorithms are used which reveal trends opinions and other patterns that would have required door to door campaigning a few decades ago this data also includes an analysis of social media websites the firm uses this data to predict outcomes based on the coherency of opinions of the people with that of a political leader the task at hand for the political leader now would be to convert more people in his favor data will give reports of the constituencies where the vote might swing in either way the leader capitalizes on these areas micro targeting potential voters were widely used during obama's campaign of this included specific tv advertisements and tailor made social media messages to influence people these customized campaigns have helped many leaders and their use is becoming more prominent while on one side everything seems bright the use of big data raises some serious concerns as well one of the biggest concerns that have been raised is the issue of data privacy accurate analysis requires huge volumes of good quality data it is claimed that most of the data gathered are through primary research surveys polls etc primary research has its limitations and there is always a risk of data being highly skewed it has been accused that most of the data usually being gathered is secondary research data under the guise of primary data cambridge analytica was accused of using personal data of american citizens through facebook while it was working for state senator ted cruz scandals like these raise serious concerns about the misuse of ones' data by political leaders data manipulation is another concern that has affected elections accusations were made on russian hackers for manipulating us presidential elections by accessing research data and private emails of electoral candidates though these are just accusations it does not deny the fact that it might be a possibility in the future while data has empowered political leaders it is on them on how they choose to utilize this information a leader can choose to hide his personal opinions and intended agendas just to maintain consistency with the masses or intentionally design a manifesto which portrays him as the most ideal candidate amplification of malpractices which the authorities might not be able to detect in due time is a serious concern while data is enlightening statistical use of human preferences and equating human lives to pointers being justified is certainly food for thought big data and analytics is a double edged sword whose effectiveness will continue to bring more political leaders towards it and for now the bonus of using it appropriately remains with the leaders but the incentive to misuse it is fairly high

146,what is artificial intelligence today we talk a lot about artificial intelligence and how it will change our future but we do not know what it actually means let us see what is artificial intelligence artificial intelligence was coined in the s as a task which is performed by a machine with the intelligence a human can use to complete the task in layman language it acts a situation in the same manner in which a human would act if the human can answer to a question in a conversation so would ai can it analyses the information and makes future decisions in the same way in which a human would ai basically works on an algorithm it uses a computers intellect to solve the problem quicker and more accurate than a human can ai mostly consists of statistical information to find trends and patterns in the data ai can perform various functions like analyzing planning problem solving and learning another part of ai is machine learning which gathers information learns and adapts as it accumulates new data stages of artificial intelligence the artificial intelligence consists of three main stages artificial narrow intelligence this is the first stage of ai as it functions narrowly it functions like an infant baby where it covers only one functional area ani can be used in the best manner when you have to use it in a reparative manner it is very cost saving as we do not need to hire any human and pay him on a monthly or weekly basis artificial general intelligence this is the stage which is the biggest achievement in the entire humanity as it covers a broad area in the technological space humans have finally constructed a machine which not just think but also has the reasoning ability with agi machines now have an ability similar to humans machines have become capable of doing things which are performed by humans agi is working with governments and organizations in problem solving and abstract thinking also however it is still in evolution and it will take some time to replace all the abilities of a human and work parallelly with him but with this can humans sustain artificial super intelligence asi is the final stage of artificial intelligence as predicted by the scientists in which machines will automate the tasks where average human intelligence is used if ai reaches that stage it will not only discover the mysteries of the universe but also able to solve the problems which are not discovered by mankind right now how ai is building a business model ai has narrowed the gap between businesses and technology it reduced the burden of tasks on skilled individuals and it has helped in easing decision making processes the traditional it methods which are solving precise specific and repetitive problems have reduced the business and technology to one of user and tool ai's powerful reasoning and contextualizing ability are now making businesses to be more proactive with their forecasts and solutions traditionally where a business model is forcing humans to define rules for machines to follow ai has derived its own rules from data which is provided to it this has led to businesses taking less time to ask questions and more time to act on the answers the time which skilled labor used to take in modifying their tools to ensure their inferences are correct the more time can be spent on working proactively on solutions for their businesses ai will not replace the workers but ai will add value to their skills with which they can leverage their businesses the self healing and adaptable power of ai programs will help management to stop worrying about the logistics of data and to start thinking on ways to leverage this power to discover the areas which were impossible to explore because off less time or insufficient information in today's technological world businesses are about to shift from more reliance of human decisions less forecasting errors and few necessities for subjective management calls will help

147,“as you sow so you reap ” because “god watches everything ” i often wonder if god is not really “the god” but just a person with infinite life and great acumen for analytics because then only he would be able to predict and manipulate our future based on our actions i am not an atheist it is just that i could not find a better metaphor to depict the power of analytics analytics is a way of interpreting and communicating relevant and meaningful patterns in data thus it is obvious that for the existence of analytics it requires data now the good news is that data is everywhere every single human impression online or offline is data but the bad news is that it is extremely difficult to filter out the relevant information from the ocean of data well for a relief analytics is getting evolved to take care of this issue as well the answer of the evolved analytics to the issue of finding relevant data is web embedded in artificial intelligence in simple words if you are searching for particular information let us say about a word adam which could be anything a name any brand a restaurant or whatsoever web will analyze your location your interests through your impressions on the internet and on the basis of them it will show the results for the word “adam” that are most relevant to you the companies these days find the positioning of their products and brands the most crucial and challenging task with a myriad of similar brands with similar offerings it is really difficult to make a dominant impression on the minds of the consumers after digital platforms coming into the picture the power has passed into the hands of the consumers from the selection of delivery channels selection of communication channels to the selection of payment methods every component in the distribution channel is an offering bundled with the actual product service thus companies are leveraging the attributes of the distribution channels as the point of differentiation to stand out in the horde of brands in order to control and optimize these attributes the brands are trying to decipher the behavior of the consumers and their preferences by critically analyzing their on site and in store buying patterns this need of the marketers has led to the introduction of what we call the age of analytics so let us look at some great and unique ways in which analytics has helped the firms to accurately analyze and predict consumer buying behavior let us design this recipe of success by fragmenting analytics into its different kinds and then explaining the role of each fragment in designing the business plan for any firm so depending upon the field of analysis and the objective of analysis analytics can be largely fragmented into predictive analytics prescriptive analytics descriptive analytics retail analytics store assortment and stock keeping unit optimization marketing optimization and marketing mix modeling web analytics now let us look at the different stages involved in the designing of a business plan for any firm and the right kind of analytics to be applied for that particular stage industry analysis understanding the battleground it is important to analyze the industry in which the firm is operating one cannot compare the sales of a geo textile manufacturing company with a company that manufactures biscuits thus analyzing the industry standards is the first and foremost step towards developing a successful business plan for this stage the firm needs descriptive analytics tools which can interpret the past data of the industry into meaningful patterns and trends which are easier to study also the industry standards must be converted into measurable terms so as to define a reference point for the firm determining internal competencies understanding the power of self before entering into the battleground a firm must be aware of its own strengths and weaknesses weakness is a term that can transform the fate of a firm a company which is aware of what not to do is better than a company which knows what to do the descriptive analytics will again come into the play but in a different context now the approach will company centric this will include determining the infrastructural and customer service capabilities of the firm and the external opportunities and threats to the firm from the data obtained through primary and secondary research techniques understanding the consumers the center of every business plan is the consumer thus understanding their needs and preferences becomes an urgent requirement for the business plan the answer to this urgency is predictive analytics predictive analytics takes the past buying behavior and buying a pattern of the consumers as the input for the analysis the key tasks are to predict the perceived value of the offerings in the minds of consumers the consumer involvement with the product and the factors influencing the consumers' buying behavior competition understanding the rivals from the industry analysis only one can draw a rough idea about the best performing firms in the industry and a bit about their positioning strategies but this is not enough determining the secret ingredient of their recipe is the key motive of conducting competitors' analysis the task is difficult thus it requires a synergy of descriptive as well as predictive analytics with the help of the trends and patterns designed through descriptive analytics the firm has to predict the key competencies the target segment and the promotion strategies of its competitors plan the strategy after doing the complete background check of the industry the competitors and the company itself it is time to act the action plan has to be comprehensive feasible measurable and well directed towards the goal of the company prescriptive analytics serves the purpose of this stage the results from the past analyses will serve as the input data for this stage in this stage the firm will make strategies for market optimization brand assortment stock keeping unit optimization marketing mix modeling and communication channel strategy implement the strategy implementation is a crucial phase a company implements a strategy at a large level may be national or at times at the global level thus to track the data becomes the most challenging task in this phase now why is the data so important well a business cycle never ends incremental development is the key to survival in the market thus to measure the success of the strategy to accurately predict the consumer behavior for future strategies for retaining the consumers through post purchase strategies a company must manage its data very wisely measuring the success in the planning phase the well directed objectives were set and the decisions were made with assigned parameters or kpis to measure the success of the plan in the implementation phase a large amount of data is collected representing the actual reaction of the consumers towards the company's strategy now in the measurement phase the actual reaction of the consumers will be put against the expected reaction for managing such a large quantity of data big data analytics is the solution after the measurement phase the company will have a clear picture of what went wrong and what went right this will build the base of the company's future strategies analytics has made things simpler and complex at the same times on one side where analytics provides simple solutions for designing a better business plan at the same time it is making the competitions more intense and competitors more unpredictable in the end the things that have always created a difference are intuition and self belief and analytics is meant just to provide a basis for those beliefs and inner feelings blackcoffer insights pratham kashyap iim rohtak,67,“as sow reap ” “god watches ” god “the god” person infinite life

148,according to jack welch legendary ceo “people related decisions have a huge impact on an organization's success and failure” traditionally these decisions were largely based on intuitions and biases but now there is a use of data and analytics tools to inform decisions about how to manage people big companies like teach for america and google adopted this technique and started using workplace data to build better employees professional sports has been ahead of almost the entire non sports world in using these tools because its whole existence is based on the performance of individuals hard data is used to make soft skill decisions about hiring and talent development it can be done on the basis of performance evaluation by figuring out how hard people are working based on analyzing the outcomes by them because we tend to judge people on an outcome and not process but the fundamental challenge in this is a range of outcomes can occur due to factors outside the employee's control so this is a challenge separating skill from the luck for instance if the performance measure is pretty high on the good outcomes scale then you can be quite confident that it is because of high effort but it can also be a low effort with favorable environmental factors that resulted in a good outcome as a consequence unless they are in a very similar situation it is difficult to compare them to one another these type of situation need a detailed analysis to drive business performance also in this they try to test the people based on their persistence level because skills persist chance does not persist regression to mean is also one of the best method suggested by wharton's top professors for instance if you sample say a person's running speed and then look at what their language ability is the fastest runners almost by definition will not necessarily be the people with the best language ability but that is not because there is some inverse relationship between language and running ability it is that these two traits are simply imperfectly correlated and so when you sample them on the extreme you have to expect regression to the mean on any other attribute it is very important to choose the sample data especially small samples for instance where are you most likely to see the dramatically higher percentage of boys than girls or vice versa born on any given day a smaller or larger hospital the small hospital of course could see large variations because you might have all girls in one day all the boys on another day in a small hospital there is no way you have that in a larger hospital this means that we should be very careful to not follow our intuition on what it means when we look at small sample because they might not be the true representation of the whole data so this is a place where data can make big difference in as opposed to just relying on intuition to predict something a higher number of people should be involved in the process so that we get a number of judgments higher the number of judgments lead to a higher chance of coming close to the truth because of idiosyncratic errors but this is based on a condition that opinions are independent because in case if they are not that would be equal to a small group of people giving judgments so more data analysis helps in making better decisions hiring the right people can also be effectively done by job knowledge tests cognitive ability tests structured interviews personality tests personality test is specially used in the retail sector where skill set requirement varies based on market type recently india's largest power producer ntpc has rolled out a basket of initiatives for its employees as it seeks to reposition its hr function to align with the fast changing environment also according to a recent study by professional network linkedin analytics specialists are in high demand for hr roles as an increasing number of companies are turning

149,for the majority of us indians the first encounter with artificial intelligence ai was perhaps when arnold schwarzenegger displayed undying machismo in ‘the terminator' unless ai relating technology was your business james cameron was perhaps the person who introduced ai to the indian masses and provided a reference of what ai is capable of well in an extremely entertaining way the concept of ai can be termed as a wine aged well much of the things which would have been considered as fantasies yesterday can be at least comprehended today if not already a reality the world is aging and hence the percentage working population is rapidly declining but the population is not and definitely not the resources available this is specifically where artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning will play a pivotal role as they can be instrumental in adapting to latest labor dynamics increase overall productivity have a competitive advantage and ultimately help in survival the timeline of the evolution of artificial intelligence and its sister areas is illustrated via the below graphic source nvidia statista the role of artificial intelligence is to ease human life and bring in incremental changes in processes involving human life the role of artificial intelligence is perhaps best explained by andrew ng the co founder of google brain and coursera the online mooc pioneer he says “the industrial revolution freed humanity from much repetitive physical drudgery i now want ai to free humanity from repetitive mental drudgery such as driving in traffic ” the automotive industry was perhaps the first industry to realize the potential of ai and united states and japan the two warhorses of automobiles post wwii era were perhaps the first countries to actually work towards realizing this potential the new jersey factory of general motors was one of the first assembly lines to host an automotive arm these automotive arm has now become a pre requisite of any assembly line the car which would have taken months to build can be built within a day just because of automation a complete ai based process would do wonders the weakness of achilles lied in his heels while the biggest weakness of automobile industry has been humans the very species it intends to serve the majority of the car accidents that happen on the face of the earth have a human error in its cause the human error may serve in the invention of penicillin but definitely does not help in making roads safer that is where driverless cars come into the picture let us take an example of uber or ola or didi chuxing what are the attributes where they lack and what are the factors that prevent maximum monetization the answer lies in the drivers uber has not only bore the brunt of misappropriating behaviors of its drivers but also seen drivers unionizing to get a bigger piece of the pie the scenario of uber moving completely to autonomous driving vehicles not only increases the safety of the system but also helps in maximizing profits although a definite possibility of the future it will take some time to get implemented till we see level autonomy vehicles being rolled out the innovations in the healthcare industry were often restricted to digitizing and ‘automating' the manual tasks to make them easier the machines involved were not self learning and would doctor's interpretation but the advent of ai has restructured the healthcare industry the next years will see personalization of healthcare industry diagnosis therapy diet and treatment would not require doctors and would be taken care entirely by machines where does the value lie for the companies in this again the same cause and effect diagram is what we can imagine ai powered healthcare firms will eliminate a large number of middlemen which are often prone to error the majority of the deaths caused by cancer are due to failure to detect early signs and act on it this will not be the case if the powers of ibm watson are made available to the general public there will be no complaints even if ibm charges a premium for it not only this with a doctor to patient ratio of this specifically serves india well as it solves the problem of accessibility and quality this is synonymous with the recent success of reliance jio whose success can be attributed to the one most important parameter – accessibility one of the most important problems that social media giants face today is of users leaving their platform or not staying long enough on the platform this may be because they find the content uninteresting irrelevant or even because of abuses and threat to privacy these parameters are important to these social media companies because their revenue models revolve around them what artificial intelligence can do is curate the content for a particular user according to his liking and protect his privacy to an extent he she demands this will in turn ensure that users continue to use their platform more and more and their activity in turn monetizes it ai powered companies apply machine learning techniques like logistic regression decision tree random forest etc to help companies study the buying behavior of the customer and extract maximum value out of them another major field where artificial intelligence will create a definite value is in the field of finance and wealth management the major problem that banks face today is dealing with the non performing assets what ai can do in this case is factually and accurately predict the credit risk of an entity thus minimizing the npas and maximizing the profits other problems that many people face is of sub par returns from their investments artificial intelligence can ensure that a superior analysis will in turn give a bit of better advice to the customers this will ensure the elimination of human emotional volatility another impact of ai is in the field of fraud detection where anomalies and patterns are studied to detect fraud and predict fraud paypal the us based payment giant implemented ai to detect and predict fraud and brought the fraud rate down to compared to industry average of to summarize artificial intelligence can deliver real value by reducing the costs of human error human inefficiencies content customization increase in production rate efficient decision making and maybe ways which we cannot comprehend as of today one of the most profound impacts of artificial intelligence has been in the field of human resources both in human resource management and the hiring processes ai has been successful in predicting candidate attributes thus making the hiring process more efficient this ensures that the company onboard the best company match candidates and reduce the future inefficiencies and lag ings ai powered hiring saves a ton of recruiter hours thus saving time and money besides this ai has the capability to achieve resource

their upstream midstream and downstream operations refinery shutdowns handling various grades of crude oil and changing environmental regulations are pushing gross refining margins down to a bare minimum with the use of iot refineries can plan their shutdowns minimize their downtime and improve safety record in fact refineries that have incorporated iot in their operations are known as smart refineries iot is the next step in the evolution of the oil and gas industry it will play a significant role in lower operating expenses and increase the reliability of the complete production plant o g companies around the world are now focussing on iot to increase overall efficiency and decrease non productive time as well as costs basically iot covers the entire value chain of the oil and gas industry right from pinpointing the location and exploration of oil wells to refining crude oil to the transportation of oil through pipelines and trucks from the trillions of dollars that are spent every year on exploration and production e p a very small investment in iot will reap huge benefits to the entire chain of petroleum operations preventative maintenance pm the o g industry loses billions of dollars every year due to non productive time npt iot could be used to help reduce npt events by using real time data to predict breakdowns and schedule preventative maintenance this in itself is a huge field of application of iot preventive maintenance pm is continuously monitoring certain parameters of the equipment like vibration temperature oil levels and those parameters which are critical to the operation of the equipment through sensors the sensors continuously relay real time data to the receiver due to this the management can accurately determine when there is need of maintenance and the time spent on repairing the machine after it is broken down as well as the greater losses that the organization had to face due to production losses are completely eliminated in the o g sector pm can be used for pumps compressors heat exchangers steam traps relief valves and all those equipment where doing instrumentation is expensive and difficult and failure of these will lead to high monetary losses billions of dollars in savings have been achieved by industries that incorporated iot in their plants for pm the petropiar refinery chevron pdvsa joint venture in mejorador jose barcelona venezuela installed predictive management software in conjunction with hart field instruments using these technologies enabled the refinery to increase production reduce costs and improve profitability smart pipelines pipelines form the transportation backbone of the o g industry for a refinery there are pipeline networks which scale thousands of kilometers through rugged lands and mountains caring for the black gold maintenance and supervision of pipelines in terms of theft leaks and corrosion is very important but with such a huge network this is not possible using wired technology a pipeline leak will cause oil to leak at a very high flow rate due to the high pressure differential created and hence immediate leak detection plays a critical role iot along with supervisory control and data acquisition scada plays an immensely important role here represented here is the schneider electric and cisco “smart connected pipeline” it is an open end to end solution for pipeline management that provides future ready communication architectures for integrated automated pipeline operations through the use of modern it technologies iot has enabled companies to save millions of dollars in oil losses due to pipeline leaks or theft asset management to increase operational efficiency a typical petrochemical industry has millions of equipment both large and small and hence it is an asset intensive industry the assets can range from pressure relief valves prvs to heat exchangers he to huge distillation columns dc identifying the efficient working of the larger equipment is easy as all the important parameters like temperature pressure flow and level are wired to the dcs it is a failure of the smaller equipment that goes unnoticed which over a period of time leads to operational inefficiency when this smaller equipment is fitted with sensors and transformed into a thing that can send data to the cloud system we get real time analysis of the complete operation and can quickly identify as to what the issue is a classic example of asset management for a very critical but non instrumented part is emerson's process management's successful implementation of iot at denka singapore pte ltd a subsidiary of denka chemical company and one of the world's largest facilities for continuous polymerizationsteam is a very important heating utility at denka as the steam travels through pipes it keeps on condensing after exchanging heat with the concerned process fluid and becomes condensate this along with non condensable gases has to be removed and that is done by steam traps an incorrectly operating steam trap results in lower heating efficiency and escape of live steam and with industry studies showing steam trap failure rate in the region of a year denka's was and given hundreds or even thousands of steam traps in the typical facility the cost consequences associated with failure are significant denka's approach towards the correction of steam traps was like other process facilities manual checking by a contractor on an annual basis this caused a large amount of steam to go waste which created financial as well as energy loss to automate the laborious process of steam trap monitoring and provide far more frequent updates on the health of steam traps in the denka plant emerson process managementarchitected and deployed a native iot solution at the equipment level to sense i e listen for steam leakage emerson's rosemount wireless acoustic transmitters configured on a wireleshart mesh network are attached to of the most critical high pressure high capacity steam traps in the facility data collected at the wirelesshart gateways are then transmitted via local telecom provider's singtel's g cellular network to analytics software hosted on a microsoft azure cloud platform for generation of steam trap performance reports the acoustic patterns of the condensate are different than the acoustic pattern of steam it is this change that the sensor monitors and reports some of the most fascinating facts about this iot solution are no involvement with the plant dcs thus alleviating the common concerns of interference and security with the dcs implementation of the iot solution is simplified as there is no connection with dcs the complete system software as well as sensors is provided at no upfront capital but at a monthly service fee thus the capital expenditure is replaced by the operational expenditure the steam traps are not analyzed at denka but at emerson's sensing regional centre thus creating no additional burden on denka creation of a weekly extension report which contains details of the failed steam traps needing replacement creation of a monthly savings report containing information of the steam leakage and equivalent financial loss after implementing this solution the steam trap failure rate went down from to less than and steam consumption decreased by which will directly impact on increasing the company's bottom line smarter oilfield operations this is an example of smart operations for a leading o g service provider taken from cognizant the client wanted to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs for thousands of electric submersible pumps esps esps are lowered into boreholes to provide artificial lift when the underground pressure is too weak to force oil to the surface the engineer needs to periodically reset each pump's motor speed to optimize production this depends on the good conditions such as pressure viscosity as well as market prices historically reprogramming the pump profile requires dispatching an engineer to the oilfield which is not only a waste of time but also a costly proposition that sometimes requires helicopter travel to a dangerous land or sea location cognizant began optimizing the problem by conducting an end to end analysis of all current systems and processes identifying opportunities to optimize software hardware and processes regarding esps based on the analysis cognizant engineers developed an iot solution to efficiently gather sensor information analyze it to determine optimal esp settings and program those settings over the network using the pump software developed by cognizant the client's engineers could recalibrate pumps over the network like adjusting motor speed according to the data generated by the software with just a few clicks instead of traveling to remote oilfields this can be done for a lot of pumps at the same time thus maximizing the utilization of the oilfield as well as reducing costs the same interface enables engineers to configure rules to prevent equipment failure — for example by shutting down equipment when drill temperature reaches degrees and resuming when the temperature falls to degrees based on the software the client also received alerts about impending pump failures thus enabling him to take preventative measures before the pump fails the repair work is much faster and unplanned breakdowns have reduced thus increasing the productive time as well as customer satisfaction the importance of iot can be clearly understood in this case as the efficiency of operations has been greatly increased there is immense data being generated in the oil and gas industry and rightly tapping and understanding this data will be beneficial blackcoffer analytica

151,of the many similarities between big data and a marketer one thing stands out both have an insatiable appetite for information if you do not know what is broken you will not be able to fix it in an era where the cliché “change is the only constant” is relevant more than ever people are looking at big data and analytics to make their decisions more data driven big data is evolving into a necessity for the business not just to analyze and predict future outcomes but also to create and shape them it is slowly becoming the oxygen for a company and the company's survival in the long run might depend on its effectiveness in using big data humans are not the best at expressing their needs some human needs are so latent that people do not even realize their existence thankfully we no longer have to rely only on questionnaires and interviews for data collection collecting customers' preferences through their online behavioral pattern and analyzing them can provide much better results this can be used to take the level of customization a customer experiences to a whole new level big data provides insights into the decision journey of an individual before buying a product the marketing team can identify the key features in the product that attract the customers it is also indispensable in understanding the local markets and helps in coming up with marketing strategies at regional levels fig example impact of big data and analytics on marketing strategies source customers nowadays do not want products pushed to them and would rather prefer buying stuff at their convenience thus it has become necessary that a high degree of customization and accuracy is required while marketing products to customers whether a person is your customer or not may depend on that first product you recommend to him equally important is the appropriate pricing of the product big data analytics can help in determining the ideal price of the product it can also provide insights into the possibility of differentiated pricing of products based on the customer's willingness to pay big data can be used to leverage the next best alternative nba marketing approach this is a customer centric approach wherein unique real time promotional offers for a customer are considered and the optimal one is determined this is radically different from the traditional approach of creating offers for the product first and then attempting to prospect big data and analytics can also help in brand management by analyzing customer reviews comments over a period of time this is one of the best ways to identify customer's expectation from the product the reason for any sharp change in the level of overall satisfaction must be analyzed tangentially it can also be used to identify new potential markets and facilitate product diversification forrester reveals that big data and analytics are being used by of bc marketers to improve responsiveness and that actively use analytics

152,analytics it outsourcing should be a strategic partnership not a simple hand off of duties to a third party getting that right requires smart preparation implemented correctly strategic partnerships are a happy collaboration where expectations of delivery and results are clear from the start by bringing in outside minds it is possible to innovate and drive your product to levels beyond what your internal team might have accomplished new ideas can come from anywhere a proper planning phase is important it is not only about thinking ahead but also about being on the same page with your analytics it outsourcing provider every day and benefiting from their expertise as opposed to viewing analytics it outsourcing merely as an easy way to offload commodity work you need to select the proper engagement model that is transparent to both parties and provides strong governance for all aspects of the relationship to accomplish that it is useful to understand the various analytics it outsourcing engagement models and how to best apply them to your situation—in the case discussed here software development an engagement model is a framework that defines collaboration between a client and an analytics it outsourcing vendor it determines a level of control and responsibility as well as provides a base for further relationship development there is no “best” universal model to match every company s needs so how do you select an engagement model that works for your business here is a brief overview of the most popular models grouped into tactical and strategic engagements tactical engagement models staff augmentation is the simplest model this approach allows companies to extend existing in house staff with outsourced workers the typical client's business driver for such a model is cost reduction it may work fine on a short term basis although it requires high client involvement to supervise the augmented staff it means that project management and technical leadership remain on the client's side while routine development or testing for example can be augmented with offshore or nearshore resources provided by an analytics it outsourcing vendor there is no need to argue that the level of innovation from outsourced vendors with this model will be quite low in most cases in fact the less span of responsibility the fewer drivers to innovate exist with the staff augmentation model the span of responsibility usually is quite narrow it may include technical implementation tasks as well as prototyping but the product vision and decision scope of the augmented team members are so limited that it does not facilitate thinking outside of the box it is important to set proper expectations and establish alignment between a client and analytics it outsourcing vendor on which party is responsible for steps in the product development life cycle – it helps avoid solving unpleasant issues in the future project based is a time bound engagement model effective for projects where requirements are not likely to change during the development process it allows reducing cost and time to market by leveraging an outsourced vendor with the required technical and domain expertise however if requirements are frequently evolving or the planned engagement scope is more than one transactional project it is better to consider strategic engagement models such as offshore nearshore development center odc ndc or product development services pds tactical consultancy is a generic term for a number of value add services the client's business driver here is the access to expertise not available in house such as ux design architecture and technology advisory security assessment and so on it is usually provided by an analytics it outsourcing vendor as a fixed price time bound activity although for the uncertain r d type of work the t m basis can be considered as well strategic engagement models the next three models belong to the strategic group as they are based on long term and more innovative relationships between a client and the analytics it outsourcing vendor organization offshore nearshore development center is a flexible engagement model that greatly increases clients' product development capacity when product requirements are driven by a client offshore nearshore development center odc ndc staff is managed by an analytics it outsourcing vendor this model can accommodate a high variety of projects and activities such as new product development legacy modernization and maintenance testing services and other long term activities however clients who look for disruptive innovations and a larger span of vendor responsibility should consider the pds model which is next in our list product development services is the most innovative strategic engagement model that maximizes outputs from an analytics it outsourcing relationship the term pds came from forrester s comparison of traditional pds executed through project based or odc models with a new innovative approach where the outsourced vendor holds a wide span of responsibility by designing and co creating a product with a client after the product release the vendor motivated by an outcome based contract continues product optimization and sustainability this way the entire product life cycle can be outsourced to a strategic partner strategic consultancy is a value driven consulting engagement aimed to improve process efficiency and the product quality of a client's organization usually it includes all aspects of the people process technology triangle with a high impact on a client's transformation and strategic decision making the key takeaway is selecting a proper engagement model and ensuring that your tactical and strategic plans are shared with your partner will help you set up a solid foundation for further innovation there is no need to stop at one or another level—continue evolving through engagement models over time to receive more value from long lasting and fruitful partnerships,48,analytics outsourcing strategic partnership simple hand duties party requires smart preparation implemented correctly

153,modern companies want to know everything about their customers they want to know where they are going who they are meeting what they are eating and of course what they are buying they are one step ahead of the potential customer knowing what she will do before she does herself this of course only a distant dream just a few years back is a reality today the reason behind this is big data analytics which is changing the way businesses function in the banking and finance industry its applications go much further than customer data and the potential for its uses are immense to the say the least here are a few significant areas where firms can and are benefitting from big data analytics customer segmentation and personalized marketing although we might consider ourselves to be unique statistically speaking we can always be clubbed under a fixed set of personality profiles or customer segments these profiles can almost with precision predict most of our online activity patterns and purchase behavior this particular application of big data is one which spans sectors in banking this helps the banks deliver the right offer or product to the right customer segment taking customer segmentation a step further personalized marketing is what garners the most hits depending on whether the consumer is looking to buy a house or some clothes he is offered a house loan or a credit card customized offerings are made to individual customers after analyzing their recent purchase activity and online behavior cross selling or the act of selling an existing customer an additional product is another practice that has become easier to convert into a sale due to customization using personalized data risk management and fraud by nature the banking industry is a sector where the firm not only wants to but should know about its clients user card limits loan sanctions and credit scores are all metrics requiring deep insight into the behavior of the consumer and big data has been a panacea to the hurdles in these activities high risk customers come with the likelihood of default but are also the drivers of revenue with analytical modeling a risk assessment predictor forecasts the default risk probability which helps the banks take a suitable decision the risk reward tradeoff is optimized which in turn maximizes profitability these models are also used by banks to frame their credit policies and strategies credit exposure is managed right from its origination to fulfillment default percentages are now internalized in the policies and the banks have effective provisions in place for them fraud analytics is perhaps the most sought after predictive analytics related information in the banking sector as per a release by pti banks in india lost an estimated ₹ to frauds in that year through profiling and historical statistics fraud can not only be detected very early but it can also be prevented altogether operations optimization strategies numerous process that banks undertake can easily be automated owing to big data which would save many man hours and otherwise spent resources some examples are loan sanctions queue optimizations and process efficiency strategies an example will highlight one of the various operations optimizations that are possible through big data suppose a bank incentivizes the data updating process of customers that is carried out by employees in terms of the number of such cases an employee can update in a day after a while the employees might start taking up the easier or the less time consuming cases so as to maximize the number of updation cases they can take up this would mean a few cases might not get taken up at all this would be an undesirable situation with big data analytics it would be possible to analyze and assign weights to the cases that get left out to modify the incentivization process this rather simplistic example is representative of the numerous ways processes in a firm can be optimized regulation it is a well known fact that banks and financial institutions have to meet a lot of mandatory regulatory requirements analytics models are used to predict and hence internalize a lot of requirements that the banks may have to comply with beforehand this ranges from a lot of things such as prediction of stress days i e days on which higher than usual withdrawals happen to meet the minimum liquidity requirements to macro level predictions to make provisions for taxations or exposure since the financial crisis the number of such compliance norms has grown even further and a lot of them have been enforced very recently this means the banks have yet to make much headway on a standardized efficient way of tackling them big data analytics holds the key to successful compliance in this regard feedback customer relations can be considered as the foremost driver of business growth in a lot of aspects based on the customer segmentation strategies and the feedback received from the individuals big data can help predict the best possible tactic for grievance redressal which in turn can maximize customer satisfaction organizational development and employee relations employee engagement is an area that arguably has the maximum scope for big data applications it can be used in salary and incentive optimization to maximize performance identifying employees at attrition risk both current and at entry level to reduce turnover and to incorporate their feedback to increase the satisfaction and hence productivity thus in a data powered world enhancing capabilities in big data analytics can drive sustainable growth reduce risk and maximize performance though its implementation is yet to be materialized on a large scale judging by its potential for value addition it would not be long before it becomes commonplace big data analytics is the driver of a revolution and there is no turning back blackcoffer analytica iii shoumik bose

160,introduction every day the world is creating roughly quintillion bytes of data the applications of big data could have a lasting impact on the lives of the people if it could be effectively used in government backed organizations and in the use of the general public politics is one such field where it could impact our lives tremendously existing use of big data analytics in politics big data analytics is being excessively used by political parties in analyzing the mood of the voters in a specific region so that they could strategically target the swing voters and focus on the target areas where their chances of winning are the most it has been used prominently in various elections all around the world recently it actually makes sense to micro target the voters on the basis of how likely they are going to vote for a specific leader or how is the image and perception of a leader in the minds of the voters next big thing the next big use of big data analytics could be for the potential voters who could actually get to know their leaders in a better and quantifiable way which would ultimately help them in choosing the right leader most of the electors vote for the political leaders on the basis of their image and recent perception the claims which the leaders make in their election manifestoes are not much used by the general public and is never quantified as to whether the tall claims which these leaders had made in the past were completed timely or not the track record of the leaders is not judged and analyzed by the general public as it is a humongous task for an individual big data analytics could actually help the electors and the general public in knowing their potential leaders closely the claims which these leaders have made in the past decade either through manifestoes or through election rallies could be listed with the score being assigned to every task on the basis of effective and timely completion these tasks would vary hugely so weights could be assigned to them depending on its implementation and its impact on the lives of people directly or indirectly these days the lives of the political leaders are closely being followed on the internet with the help of news channels magazines blogs and social media as well all this data could be captured and relevant information could be clubbed together to create meaningful insights the leaders interact with people on social media and there conduct and behavior could be easily captured such a tool could be very actively used in comparing the competing leaders in a specific region usage all this information could be of great use to the public because in the fast paced world it is very difficult for working class people to interact with the leaders by attending the election rallies big data analytics could be effectively used by the leaders in communicating their points to the general public and in return it could also be used as a tool by the general public in knowing their political leaders this tool could also be used for the self improvement purpose of the politicians wherein they could analyze their own behavior and also feedback can be captured for specific points of the behavior the overall budget of the elections has been increasing significantly over the past decades roughly rs crore were spent in the lok sabha elections in and this amount would increase manifold in the coming elections big data analytics could actually help in reducing the overall expenditure incurred by the political parties as the battleground is expected to shift to the social media in the coming elections and all the analysis could prove to be worthy enough as an excellent tool also it is very important to understand that choosing the right leader could impact the lives of the people for the next years sponsorship big data analytics could be used by rating agencies which could actually launch ratings for politicians and this could be used by the general public in determining how good the leader is once the ecosystem is in setup it could be sponsored by the leader itself wherein the party or the leader would want to rate the previous results and personality which if quantified could substantiate their claims in the current scenario obviously the second model would have to be properly audited else it would lose out the credibility even the government led organizations could actually keep a track of the election manifestoes of the leaders and then keep a real time track of the progress of the key developments relating to the subjects in the set agenda

163,big data has emerged as one of the biggest business and technological buzzwords of recent years the term big data applies to information that cannot be processed or analyzed using traditional tools or processes a number of it companies are leading the development of big data analytics programs and are creating unique packages for retailers which suggests that it is going to have a big impact on the retail industry using big data to identify promotion items that actually grow category sales and store profits are the top opportunities identified by retail professionals innovations in big data and retail often bog down in the vastness of its potential leaving retailers with only the vaguest guidance as they try to figure out where and how to invest in this powerful tool most early big data efforts are targeted at sourcing and analyzing internal data which also true for retailers in retail industries internal data is the primary source of big data with retail organizations retailers should take a pragmatic approach to adopt big data and also that there is tremendous untapped value still locked away in their internal systems value making big data sources for retailers are transactions log data events e mails social media sensors external feeds rfid scans or pos data free from text geospatial audio still images video it is advised that retailers who are active in big data efforts should analyze transactions data as well as log data transaction and log data are machine generated data produced to record the details of every operational transaction and automated function performed within the retailers' business or information systems – data that has outgrown the ability to be stored and analyzed by many traditional systems as a result in many cases this data has been collected for years but not analyzed retailers should also make use of rfid scans and point of sale pos data this is a natural area for retailers to lead given their history and dependence on pos data for transactions unlike other industries retailers severely lagged in analyzing free form text data with no retailers reporting its use compared with other industries this may represent an opportunity for some retailers to become early adopters of this area of analysis early adopters of big data are turning information into insights that deliver value to their organizations for example a global footwear retailer leverages transactional insight to generate new opportunities and business growth previously the company had its order sales inventory and financial data dispersed across the company making it difficult for managers to quickly access data needed to make critical business decisions managers could not identify products in greatest demand resulting in warehouses overstocked with less popular items and hot items on back order to enable more timely and effective operations decisions the retailer should create a seamless reporting framework that provides granular real time information from the sales floor to its suppliers' inventory and production schedules which allows targeting of new customers and better inventory forecasting in addition transactional information from the retailer's core platforms should be standardized and integrated into a single reporting framework to improve visibility into business activity enabling deeper insight into customer needs with these new capabilities managers can quickly respond to marketplace demands and address business challenges having real time and granular visibility into store level sell through and inventory data enables optimized replenishment and merchandising practices while supply chain transparency promotes lower cost logistics the solution can be positioned the company for competitive advantage by helping boost sales and lower operational costs,25,big data emerged biggest business technological buzzwords recent years term big data applies information processed analyzed

164,the ongoing digitalization of the business world is putting companies at risk of cyber attacks more than ever before big data analysis has the potential to offer protection against these attacks cyber security threats are rising since the notion of a corporate security perimeter has all but disappeared in recent years thanks to the growing adoption of cloud and mobile services information security has experienced a profound paradigm shift from traditional perimeter protection tools towards monitoring and detecting malicious activities within corporate networks increasingly sophisticated attack methods used by cybercriminals and the growing role of malicious insiders in several recent large scale security breaches clearly indicate that traditional approaches to information security can no longer keep up companies have to rethink their cyber security concepts analytics is the key element in leveraging cyber resilience with increasingly advanced and persistent attacks and the simple fact that every organization must protect itself against all varieties of attacks while an attacker only needs one successful attempt organizations must rethink their cybersecurity concepts they have to move beyond pure prevention towards the pdr paradigm prevent – detect – respond how big data analytics fits in at the core of this approach stands improved detection – and that is where big data analytics comes into play detection must be able to identify changing use patterns to execute complex analysis rapidly close to real time to perform complex correlations across a variety of data sources ranging from server and application logs to network events and user activities this requires both advanced analytics beyond simple rule based approaches and the ability to run analysis on large amounts of current and historical data – big data security analytics combining the current state of analytics with security helps organizations improve their cyber resilience big data security analytics a new generation of security tools as the security industry's response to these challenges a new generation of security analytics solutions has emerged in recent years which are able to collect store and analyze huge amounts of security data across the whole enterprise in real time enhanced by additional context data and external threat intelligence this data is then analyzed using various correlation algorithms to detect anomalies and thus identify possible malicious activities unlike traditional siem solutions such tools operate in near real time and generate a small number of security alerts ranked by severity according to a risk model these alerts are enriched with additional forensic details and are able to greatly simplify a security analyst's job and enable quick detection and mitigation of cyber attacks what made big data security analytics possible the biggest technological breakthrough that made these solutions possible is big data analytics the industry has finally reached the point where business intelligence algorithms for large scale data processing previously affordable only to large corporations have become commoditized utilizing readily available frameworks such as apache hadoop and inexpensive hardware vendors are now able to build big data solutions for collecting storing and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data in real time combining data to predict suspicious activity this makes it possible to combine real time and historical analysis and identify new incidents that could be related to others that occurred in the past coupled with external security intelligence sources that provide current information about the latest vulnerabilities this can greatly facilitate the identification of ongoing advanced cyber attacks on the network having a large amount of historical data at hand also significantly simplifies initial calibration to the normal patterns of activity of a given network which are then used to identify anomalies existing solutions are already capable of automated calibration with very little input required from administrators identifying relevant incidents based on proven big data analytics algorithms these solutions can identify outliers and other anomalies insecurity data which almost always indicate some kind of malicious or at least suspicious activity by filtering out the statistical noise big data security analytics can reduce massive flows of raw security events to a manageable number of concise and clearly categorized alerts to allow even an inexperienced person to make a decision on them still by keeping all historical information available for later analysis it provides a forensic expert with much more detail about the incident and its relationship to other historical anomalies automating workflows finally modern big data security analytics solutions provide multiple automated workflows for responding to detected threats such as disrupting clearly identified malware attacks or submitting a suspicious event to a managed security service for further analysis automated controls for cybersecurity and fraud detection have been identified as one of the key business drivers for future adoption,28,ongoing digitalization business world putting companies risk cyber attacks big data analysis potential offer protection attacks

165,challenges there is currently an explosion of electronic clinical data which can be analyzed to glean new insights into how to improve overall health and healthcare two data quality issues systematic data inaccuracies and data fragmentation need to be addressed in order to ensure that insight from electronic clinical data are valid these issues require specific attention from policymakers and practitioners and may be lessened by promoting greater interoperability and reducing burdensome documentation requirements there is enormous enthusiasm for how “big data” can address persistent cost and quality deficiencies in the healthcare system the notion is simply analyzing the massive amount of clinical information that is newly available in digital format should enable groundbreaking insights earlier detection of effective treatments better targeted clinical decision support real time biosurveillance accurate predictions of who is likely to get sick will transforming healthcare deliver its promises it will take harnessing these data to create what the institute of medicine calls a “learning health system” in which healthcare continuously identify and adopt new approaches to deliver better care at lower costs big data has generated even more excitement since the most recent election when analysts were able to use vast amounts of disparate data from polls economic indicators and historical trends to predict election outcomes with astounding accuracy yet the excitement about big data and the analytics that it requires appears to have gotten ahead of reality without more specific attention to the challenges an important tool for transforming healthcare will fail to deliver on its promise healthcare data are big but are they good the first set of challenges is those that confront all big data efforts healthcare needs continual technical advances to store and efficiently access the rapidly expanding amount of data there are also challenges that are particularly salient in healthcare the challenge that demands significantly more attention is ensuring that the data are not only big but that they are good healthcare does not have a problem with big the rate of electronic health record adoption continues to climb in both inpatient and ambulatory settings health record adoption is being used at a large scale to capture clinical care in hospitals outpatient visits and countless pharmacies laboratories and other sites and increasingly patients are using devices to track their health and health related behaviors which generate substantial data the healthcare space has achieved big with exponential growth ahead healthcare data quality the problem in healthcare lies with the quality of the data to derive insights from data it is critical that they be accurate and relatively complete when data are systematically biased through either errors or omissions the correlations that give rise to new insights will be missed or spurious and could result in misguided confidence or scarce resources dedicated to chasing down dead ends healthcare should be disproportionately concerned about data quality for reasons first a large fraction of data is entered by humans who both intentionally and unintentionally introduce systematic errors in most domains data are a natural byproduct of healthcare increasing reliance on technology internet searches online purchases and cell phone calls each create a treasure trove of data that can be mined for patterns eg flu symptom searches or used for experimentation do you buy more when the “cart” is in the upper right or the upper left the opportunities for data error are relatively limited and easily identified by algorithms hard way to solve healthcare data quality issue in healthcare critical clinical data symptoms physical signs orders and progress notes still rely heavily on human entry and will do so for the foreseeable future beyond simple data entry errors there are bigger systemic problems with clinical data in electronic format current reimbursement policies require extensive documentation and clinicians often respond by using templates that automatically populate large quantities of data or by using copy paste features that propagate mistakes or outdated information further physician documentation styles vary substantially making errors and omissions difficult to identify for instance if a patient has an empty medication list is the patient not taking any medications has the patient not informed her physician about a medication she is taking or has the physician chosen to document medications elsewhere systematic data inaccuracies have no quick fixes the most helpful long term solution would be for payers especially medicare to relax documentation requirements so that providers can focus data entry on clinical not billing needs technical solutions to healthcare data quality issue alternatively there are promising technical solutions such as machine learning a form of artificial intelligence that trains systems to make predictions about certain characteristics of data while machine learning has proved successful for identifying missing diagnoses it is of limited use for critical clinical data like symptoms and physical exam findings in addition the richest source of clinical data the clinicians' notes remains largely beyond the reach of big data there have been substantial improvements in natural language processing nlp to identify key information from clinical notes however until the quality of those notes improves it will be hard for nlp programs to glean important information continued investment in technical solutions will undoubtedly improve data accuracy but without fundamental changes to how care is documented healthcare should be circumspect about healthcare ability to rid data of systematic errors data fragmentation in healthcare even if healthcare achieves perfect data accuracy a second daunting challenge remains data fragmentation incomplete data are common in clinical practice and reflect healthcare space highly fragmented healthcare system where patients see multiple clinicians whose electronic health record do not communicate despite significant policy interest healthcare has yet to achieve any meaningful level of interoperability and without it creating a comprehensive picture of patients' care will be nearly impossible incomplete data like inaccurate data can also lead to missed or spurious associations that can be wasteful or even harmful to patient care the solutions to addressing fragmented data are no easier than those to address inaccurate data achieving greater interoperability between electronic clinical systems has been pursued by policymakers for nearly decades with little success while policymakers have recently renewed their efforts their primary focus moving specific pieces of clinical information such as a laboratory test result between individual healthcare providers will do little to ensure that provider organization has a comprehensive picture of the patient's care across all care sites many patients and privacy advocates are understandably concerned about efforts to aggregate data however with adequate de identification and security safeguards the risks of aggregation can be minimized and the benefits of better care at lower costs are substantial conclusion the potential for big data in healthcare is enormous and exciting it is hard to find a delivery system that is not thinking about how to leverage electronic health record data and researchers are eager to answer new types of questions realizing the most from healthcare's large national investment in health it demands that healthcare space learns from the newly available data doing so requires that healthcare understand the issues of data quality and address them effectively the solutions are not easy however ignoring these challenges could quickly lead healthcare from the hope of big data to the disappointing and wasteful results of bad data,54,challenges explosion electronic clinical data analyzed glean insights improve health

166,introduction dashboards are often created on the fly with data being added simply because there is some white space not being used different people in the company ask for different data to be displayed and soon the dashboard becomes hard to read and full of meaningless non related information when this happens the dashboard is no longer useful who are you trying to impress ‘does the cfo really need to know the servers are operating at capacity ' think about the audience for the dashboard the most effective dashboards target a single type of user and just display data specific to that ‘use case' is the dashboard going to be used by the executive team to monitor the company's financials or will it be used by the marketing team to monitor daily activities it is important to ensure that where possible your dashboard consists of data that is specific to a single audience often this step is overlooked and dashboards include a mix of data some of which is relevant to one audience and some to another select the right type of dashboard there are common types of dashboard each performing a specific purpose operational strategic executive analytical operational dashboards these dashboards display data that facilitate the operational side of a business for example in a business with a website it is important to ensure that your website remains up and running so you would monitor server uptime and utilization in a business with an inside sales function you may want to create a dedicated sales dashboard that displays a number of calls made and a number of appointments booked think of an operational dashboard as monitoring the nerve center of your operation operational dashboards often require real time or near real time data strategic executive dashboards strategic dashboards will typically provide the kpis key performance indicators that a company's executive team track on a periodic daily weekly or monthly basis a strategic dashboard should provide the executive team with a high level overview of the state of the business together with the opportunities the business faces this data could be periodic revenue vs prior period costs vs prior period headcount by department sales pipeline analytical dashboards an analytical dashboard could display operational or strategic data however this type of dashboard will offer drill down functionality – allowing the user to explore more of the data and get different insights often dashboards include this functionality when it is not required do not simply provide this functionality because you can bear in mind that different user groups may require a different type of dashboard the marketing manager may need both a strategic and operational view of their data where possible create two separate dashboards group data logically – use space wisely a well designed dashboard will ensure that data is displayed in logical groups for example if a dashboard includes financial kpis and sales pipeline ensure that the financial data is displayed next to each other with the sales pipeline data displayed together in a separate logical group grouping is often by department or functional area and can include product inventory development sales marketing finance actuals and forecasts people often the most important real estate on a dashboard top left hand corner is reserved for a company logo or a navigation tool this is not good dashboard practice as the part of the screen is the most important part of your dashboard this is because most western languages read from top to bottom and from left to right – hence our eye will start it is journey when discovering something new at the top left hand corner make the data relevant to the audience an executive dashboard can have a number of different audiences ensure that the data you display is relevant to the users think about the scope and reach of your data the whole company by department individuals suppliers ensure that you understand exactly who the intended audience is and the scope of their requirements in a small organization the executive dashboard is likely to include kpi data across all departments however in a larger company each department may have their own executive dashboard gaining agreement on dashboard components from non related parties are doomed to fail do not clutter your dashboard – present the most important metrics only dashboards are often cluttered cluttered displays deflect the focus from the important messages some are cluttered with useful and relevant information and some are cluttered with useless and irrelevant information neither of these situations is desirable each dashboard type may require different amounts of data for example an executive dashboard may only need numbers whereas an operational dashboard may need upwards of there is no hard and fast rule to follow here except ensuring that everything you display is relevant and meaningful to the audience do not add a graph or text simply because you can how often does the data really need to be refreshed ensuring that your dashboard data is being refreshed at the right intervals saves time during development why go through the pain of sourcing real time data when all you need is a weekly feed and can ensure optimal performance once the dashboard is live examples of refresh rates on dashboards include real time or near real time daily weekly monthly as a rule of thumb operational dashboards require data in real time or near real time whereas executive strategic dashboards require data refreshed on a less frequent basis,42,introduction dashboards created fly data added simply white space people company data displayed dashboard hard read full meaningless related information dashboard longer impress

167,can academia researchers decision makers and policy makers manage the challenges of broader collaboration and privacy to harness value from big data for academia researchers and decision makers and for many other sectors like retail healthcare insurance finance capital markets real estate pharmaceutical oil gas big data looks like a new eldorado a fantastic mine of information where we hope to find the key to great discoveries in the social sciences humanities etc for example questions such as “what is social media data telling us about our societies humanities consumers people live nearby ” or “how can big data be used to efficiently allocate resources such as energy or capital or technology or manpower ” are becoming more frequent quite naturally academia is abuzz thinking of how to best use big data big data technologies platforms it is also teeming with competitiveness as researchers race to make the discoveries waiting for us in those massive data centers a cautious approach that being said academics researchers and especially universities must exercise caution there are some unique risks that must be taken into account risks that stem from academic research being in most cases made publicly available therefore all the results obtained the methods used and often all the data collected during a research project will eventually be made publicly available this level of transparency is unique to academia so however magical big data may appear using it requires careful considerations of both data protection laws and of research ethical principles concretely when using data that was produced by individuals we must not only take care to respect their privacy when processing the data we must also ensure that the content produced cannot be used against them further precautions must be taken when working with data from vulnerable individuals such as young children and teenagers for instance in that respect the considerable experience that universities have to handle human subject data within the life sciences is of great help and existing research protocols devised in that context are being adapted to address the new challenges posed by big data from big data to big collaboration researchers in statistics and mathematics have to be mindful of and interact closely with concepts of law and ethics this is one of many examples of collaborations and interactions across academic fields driven by the use and exploration of big data the reason for this is that because big data requires a wider big data requires a wider range of expertise to be applied simultaneously to answer research questions range of expertise to be applied simultaneously to answer research questions in contrast to understand smaller traditional data sets used not so long ago knowing both the data and the methods would be sufficient to tackle most projects consider an effort to understand the drivers behind memes on twitter a meme is an idea behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture a typical research project could for example try to understand how memes develop who they spread to and why such a project would require a software engineer able to produce the database necessary to manage the large data set a statistician or machine learner to develop the proper methodology to explore the data and learn its properties a linguist to help efficiently mine the tweets by identifying the relevant semantic structures a social scientist to interpret the results and frame the research questions and so on one of the challenges for academia is that there is no culture of collaboration on this scale in the field yet finding the right skills and synergies to produce efficient teamwork is the first challenge academics face when tackling a big data project the changing nature of data but it is not the size of big data that requires so many different skills in that sense the term ‘big data' is misleading what makes big data different is the way the data is collected traditionally data was collected for a specific purpose relating to a specific scientific question academics sought to first delineate a scientific question then build the most appropriate techniques to answer that question and finally collect the appropriate data set to use the technique on this systematic process led hopefully to an answer this tradition dates back to greek antiquity when for instance eratosthenes measured the angle of the sun at different locations and used geometry to compute the circumference of the globe in this setting we have a clear research question what is the circumference of the globe to address this question eratosthenes used geometry to identify where he will find this answer the angle of the sun at different locations then he found how to accurately measure that information using a gnomon the research project presented three clear steps that could be addressed independently this paradigm is now shifting the problem big data poses for academics and data scientist in general is that extracting value and insight from the data requires doing two processes simultaneously discovering the informational content and how to extract it the ‘where' and the ‘how' must be done at the same time this is why the comparison with an eldorado and a gold rush is appropriate we know there is valuable information to be extracted from big data but we do not know where exactly to find it in the data set and or how to extract it consider the twitter memes we introduced above the research question of interest in this example is the evolution of memes and their drivers to address this question we must define where this information can be found and how to extract it the answer to both questions is the intuition that the data set tweets published online contains a massive amount of information about memes which ones are currently trending how they form and spread etc however it is unclear where the information can be found in this corpus should one automatically detect a meme should a data expert list the memes there is also no methodology on how to extract this information once located what measures should we use to describe memes evolutions how do these measures relate what measures are computationally feasible finally all these questions must be answered simultaneously to coherently address the problem the most successful solution to date is to frame very focused research questions and aim to capture only the information you are interested in and nothing else defining the scope of the project too broadly runs the risk of corrupting the extracted information or limits the ability to extract the information in a scalable way in effect to reduce the confusion caused by addressing both the ‘how' and the ‘why' at the same time research questions must be very precise and well defined using big data to understand networks the need for a focused approach can be made more concrete when considering network analysis a network is made up of individual entities and the relationships between them these can range from human social networks neural network electric networks or protein interaction networks for example we would expect that methods for analyzing one type of network would apply to others this is true in principle however the research problem of interest for each network is different for instance when considering a social network we are often interested in how communities form and interact when considering protein interaction networks we are interested in the role a particular protein plays in the overall network in terms of methodology addressing simultaneously the global scale community problem in social networks and the local scale role problem in protein networks remains an open question but by addressing each problem separately efficient methods can be devised therefore the research question must focus on one of the two aspects either local or global the incompatibility of the two approaches is due to the very different mathematical tools used to address both problems for community detection the network is regarded as a large matrix and tools usually rely on the eigenvectors of that matrix on the other hand to determine the role of each node the network is considered as a graph and the occurrence of small shapes around a given node are enumerated the former being algebraic in nature and the later combinatorial in nature it is not straightforward to articulate the two approaches in a single method one set of tools is needed to identify what community a given agent belongs to and another to describe the role of a given agent however there is not a tool that does both as a consequence it is necessary to decide which of the two aspects is to be studied in advance a threefold challenge like other sectors like healthcare retail capital market energy and many more academia sees the potential of big data to harness this potential academics face a threefold challenge generate teams with varied expertise work on very focused yet meaningful research problems while taking ethical questions into account many such efforts are appearing in academia and we are hopefully to expect a great breakthrough in the near future,67,academia researchers decision makers policy makers manage challenges broader collaboration privacy

168,introduction inventory planning is a fundamental part of retail operations proper retail inventory management which helps to balance supply and demand relies heavily on an accurate forecast of future demand in fact sales forecasting refers to predicting future demand or sales assuming that the factors which affected demand in the past and are affecting the present will still have an influence in the future it is an important task but is very difficult to accomplish in the retailing industry which is defined as the retailing business of products including apparel shoes and fashion beauty products forecasting itself can be treated like a “service” which represents the set of analytical tools that facilitate the companies to make the best decisions for predicting the future undoubtedly a good forecasting service system can help to avoid understocking or over stocking in retail inventory planning which further relates to other critical operations of the whole supply chain such as due date management production planning pricing and achieving high customer service level in order to achieve economics sustainability under a highly competitive environment a company should adopt a consumer demand driven “pull” operational strategy which means forecasting becomes a critically important task compared to other retailing service industries it is well argued that sales forecasting is a very difficult task in fashion retailing because fashion product's demand is highly volatile with the ever changing taste of the consumers and the fashion product's life cycle is very short in addition the sales of fashion products are strongly affected “stochastically” by seasonal factors fashion trend factors and many tricky variables e g weather marketing strategy political climate item features and macroeconomic trend these together with the fact that fashion retailers are carrying a large number of stock keeping units skus with limited historical sales data all make sales forecasting challenging and call for more sophisticated and versatile analytical tools on the other hand it is known that the fashion apparel supply chain is a relatively long one which includes upstream cotton plants fiber manufacturers apparel factories distributors wholesalers and retailers as a consequence the notorious bullwhip effect will have a particularly strong influence on the fashion supply chain since forecasting is a critical factor relating to the presence and significance of the bullwhip effect improving forecasting can help reduce the bullwhip effect which directly enhances the efficiency of the fashion supply chain statistical fashion sales forecasting methods traditionally fashion sales forecasting is accomplished by statistical methods in fact a lot of statistical methods have been used for sales forecasting which includes linear regression moving average weighted average exponential smoothing used when a trend is present but not linear exponential

these methods have a closed form expression for forecasting it is simple and easy to implement and the results can be computed very quickly ai fashion retail sales forecasting methods the pure statistical models have a deficiency in conducting fashion retail forecasting in order to improve forecasting accuracy ai methods emerge with the advance of computer technology in fact ai models can

the literature and they are the first kind of models being employed for fashion retail sales forecasting to be specific ann models have been developed and they provide satisfactory results in different domains hybrid methods for fashion sales forecasting hybrid forecasting methods are usually developed based on the fact that they can utilize the strengths of different models together to form a new forecasting method as such many of them are considered to be more efficient than pure statistical models and pure ai models it is not surprising that in recent years a number of research works examine hybrid forecasting methods hybrid methods employed in the fashion forecasting literature often combine different schemes such as fuzzy model ann and elm with other techniques such as statistical models the grey model gm and so forth following are more adapted hybrid methods fuzzy logic based hybrid methods neural network based hybrid methods elm based hybrid methods applications in the fashion industry sales forecasting is a real world problem in fashion retailing from the perspective on applications and implementation various issues are identified in terms of the forecasting horizon most of the existing forecasting models are suitable for middle term and long term forecasting however short term forecasting including the very short term forecasting such as real time forecasting is not yet fully explored this kind of short term forecasting is very important given the nature of the fashion industry the fashion trend is unpredictable and the lead time is very short regarding the product type to be forecasted two kinds of products are involved namely the existing product and a new product compared to the existing products forecasting prediction on new product forecasting seems to be much more complicated and difficult due to the absence of historical sales data in terms of speed in general statistical methods can output the forecasting results very quickly ai methods are usually more time consuming in the past the lead time in the fashion industry is a bit longer than now and the lead time can be ten months or even one year however the fashion industry has changed and fast fashion companies like zara h m and mango are adopting quick response strategy with a very short lead time e g weeks in zara for some products as a result forecasting result must be available within a very short time for any forecasting application for these companies,43,introduction inventory planning fundamental part retail operations proper retail inventory management helps

169,the problem insider threat detection specifically to detect data exfiltration over the network is a challenge existing perimeter security solutions and end system security are not effectively devised to handle insider attack and data exfiltration issues such as misconfiguration vulnerable points and covert network channels lead to data exfiltration hence building an effective system for detecting insider attacks remains an open challenge devising an exclusive behavior based model is essential to detect data exfiltration over the network by utilizing parameters from both system and network motivation nowadays thousands of companies and organizations have been subject to a cyber attack many hackers that exist outside of a company or an organization hacking and breaking into information systems to execute these cyber attacks but nowadays insiders that are hackers exist inside of a company or an organization are becoming a big problem and insiders are often overloaded as potential threats to commit cyber attack usually we apply some kind of security policies and access control policies which are aimed to prevent our data business policy product information secret information etc but still sometimes it fails because when we trust someone and give him her full access to network host etc they usually try to leak our data or information this is the reason that we say insider attacks are often more damaging and costly due to the knowledge of and access to information system from the recent survey done by many institutions and researchers in and we know that more than a quarter of cyber attacks were done by insiders insider threat an insider threat is a malicious hacker also called a cracker or a black hat who is an employee or officer of a business institution or agency insider threats are often disgruntled employees or ex employees who believe that the business institution or agency has “done them wrong” and feel justified in gaining revenge it is difficult to detect and prevent attacks by people with legitimate access to an organization's computers and networks represent a growing problem in our digital world these insider threats frustrate employers who lack the resources to identify them and monitor their behavior insiders are not just employees today they can include contractors business partners auditors… even an alumnus with a valid email address define an insider as a trusted entity that is given the power to violate a security policy the insider is determined in reference to an established security policy insider threat lies in the access and ability to violate a security policy using legitimate access and violate an access control policy by obtaining unauthorized access insider type there are different types of insiders that result in information leakage inadvertent intentional and malicious an inadvertent insider is a trusted person with access to sensitive information who inadvertently discloses sensitive information an intentional insider is a trusted person who knowingly discloses sensitive information and is aware of the security that it is purposefully bypassing this person may try to manipulate the content or use overt communication that preserves privacy to avoid detection a malicious insider is also a trusted person who knowingly discloses sensitive information however in addition to manipulating the content or using overt communication like an international insider tunneled or covert communication is usually employed to avoid detection data exfiltration if we talk in terms of our

ftp http smtp ssh instant messenger rootkits batnets spyware covert channels phishing pharming mitm are the medium by which data exfiltration is quite simple for insider exploits privilege escalation dns poisoning directory traversal are common attack done by an insider if we talk about physical medium of data exfiltration is also play a major role for example printing device cd dvd disc usp laptop etc are the common medium used by an insider for data exfiltration the solution to detecting data – exfiltration over the network presenting a behavior approach based on a chi square model to detect insider attack specifically data exfiltration the approach focuses on both technical as well as behavioral aspects and present methods to detect data exfiltration firstly during the learning phase profile each host in a network and compute chi square values individually for the system and network parameters secondly during the detection phase compute chi square values for the identified parameters and then superimpose current chi square values with the learned chi square values to detect data exfiltration over the network aim to develop a method to identify abnormal cyber behavior by establishing user profiles based on cyber data that is collected from the user while active on a computer to do this implement learning algorithms to establish “normal” behavioral profiles for users monitor users for anomalies in their behavior patterns it is important to state that our goal is to identify these abnormalities for example it can identify that a user is uploading an abnormally large amount of file from a directory that they do not typically access fig superimposed chi square values of outgoing packets of live data abnormal profile data and threshold threshold and threshold of learned data normal profile data for user type and respectively fig superimposed chi square values of outgoing bytes of live data abnormal profile data and threshold threshold and threshold of

characteristic of a covert channel is that it is aimed at hiding the fact that communication is taking place this differs from cryptography where there is no intention to camouflage the transmission of data but rather the goal is to make the data readable useable solely to the receiver the oldest form of a covert channel is steganography where the intention is to avoid drawing suspicion to the transmission of a hidden message source covert channels evolved from tattooing messages on a slaves scalp to embedding information into features of the tcp ip protocol although a formal definition of covertness in the field of computer science does not exist research on the detection of covert communication is very active informally we can say that an operation is more covert if it is difficult to detect without the use of special tools that specifically look for it for example let us suppose that we want to detect a user who is printing documents on a particular printer over the network for convenience we will refer to such a user simply as john suppose that we do not set up any network tools to keep records of any communication between john's workstation and the printer the only way to detect if john prints something is to see if he walks to the printer to pick up the page alternatively we may detect that every time we try to print something we discover that the printer is frequently busy and that john is waiting for his print jobs to complete if john wants to keep the operation hidden he should just print at a lower rate say one page per day nobody would detect it if instead he keeps printing all day long at the highest possible rate the operation becomes easily recognizable even printing at half the maximum rate makes the process quite noticeable if we abstract this concept we obtain the following covertness is a characteristic of an operation that can be measured by the rate of usage of the media if the apparatus is exploited at its maximum capacity the operation is easily visible with a covertness of zero if instead it is exploited at a lesser rate the operation will be increasingly covert in other words a measure of covertness is some function of distance from the capacity for a given medium therefore to keep activity as covert as possible the rate of usage compared to the capacity of the equipment should be kept as low as possible the closer the capacity is to the rate at which the operation or transmission is executed the more covert the transmission will be covertness is thus proportional to the difference between capacity and the actual rate used covertness capacity of the medium – transmission rate define three kinds of threats the unauthorized disclosure of information the unauthorized modification of information the unauthorized withholding of information usually called the denial of service,31,talk terms general life exfiltrate means surreptitiously move personnel material area enemy control terms computer

171,some vendors fruit and vegetable sellers began venturing out after a few days without explicit permission and immediately faced police harassment after a few weeks the government eased restrictions and essential vendors were being permitted to vend due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks however the cost of doing business as well as the risk has gone up significantly with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city also with the lockdown still partially in place the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings due to the harsh summer heat perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have the state has recently announced a stimulus package of inr crore for nearly lakh vendors acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood the intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of inr for all vendors but this is not sufficient instead of credit the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit a cash grant as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly the vendors need income support to be able to restart work and if they are not able to do so how will they return the loan in the face of the ever changing crisis vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods to this end vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda livelihood promotion for all vendors including those selling non essential goods the impact of covid has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets for fresh food cooked food and essential household items and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads these markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same going forward vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities running water washing stations and toilets the authorities should work with town vending committees tvcs for the same provide direct support which is de linked from existing registration requirements as lockdown is lifted and vending resumes vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work the government stimulus package while a welcome step is insufficient in the nature of relief credit not direct cash transfer and eligibility only registered vendors are eligible which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country in addition government relief and support needs to be de linked from very rigid registration requirements as very few vendors have been registered in india in delhi out of roughly street vendors only about have some form of occupational identification if the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state then the government should also accept registration with a workers' organisation union as a proxy for government issued vending passes ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending the government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work additionally vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors especially cooked food vendors in ways to maintain hygiene while working taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits as mentioned earlier the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in delhi before the crisis and subsequent lockdown the town vending committees tvcs were supposed to start surveying and registering vendors as we get used to the new normal the process of survey and registration should also begin to ensure
